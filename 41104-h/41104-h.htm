<h3>THE INVADERS</h3>


<p>It was on a boat which was laden with bananas and
running from Colon, on the Isthmus of Panama, to
New York.</p>

<p>The steward called me at dawn. He thought
I was mad because I stood in pyjamas without
apparent heed of the mirky drizzle. Beyond the
sad waters there was little to see but a low-lying
and dreary island with a melancholy lighthouse.
No vegetation brightened the scene. There was no
gorgeous sunrise. There was nothing but a lump of
barrenness heaving out of the sea. But this was
the island of San Salvador, the western land which
Columbus first touched when he sailed to find the
Indies.</p>

<p>There are now near one hundred and fifty millions
of people of European descent in the Americas.
And a little glow came into my imagination that
rain-swept morning when I felt I was the only
traveller on the boat who had crawled forth to
gaze at San Salvador. I tried to picture what
thoughts must have crowded the mind of Columbus
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
when he sighted this shore. He never knew what
he had discovered for Spain. He could never have
dreamt he was the first in the greatest invasion
the world has ever witnessed.</p>

<p>A year later I was on an Atlantic liner. The
fo'c'sle was thronged with poor Spaniards from
Vigo and poor Portuguese from Lisbon. In the
voyage across the Atlantic I had watched them
in the steerage&mdash;tawny-visaged, easygoing men, and
broad-set, figureless women, sprawling, gossiping,
drowsing. To the accompaniment of an accordion
they lifted their voices in song on the balmy,
starlit evenings whilst the ship churned through
the tropical seas.</p>

<p>Another misty morning and I climbed on deck.
Saloon passengers were tucked in their bunks. But
all the steerage had turned out and were crowding
the foredecks, and were gazing at a dim strip of
land and watching a blinking light. The land was
the coast of Brazil, and the light was the harbour
of Pernambuco, which means "the Door of Hell."</p>

<p>The immigrants raised a long-drawn shout of joy.
They hailed Latin America. There was the country
of which they had heard so much. They had broken
with the Old World. Four hundred years ago their
ancestors came across these seas with eyes greedy
for gold. Now they came, not to snatch gold from
temples or to terrorise the natives into showing
where the metal could be found, but to work on sugar
plantations, to nurture the coffee plant, to rear
bananas, to do the humble work in the building of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
towns and the construction of railways, to toil in
the jungles, to sit in the saddle and round up cattle
on the prairies. They had come to the New World
to get gold by industry.</p>

<p>How much we talk and write about the enterprise
and colonising power of the Teutonic races, and how
prone we are to dismiss the Latin races as effete
and played out! But our generalisations will not
bear examination. The spirit of adventure cannot
have left Italy and Spain and Portugal. Every
year hundreds of thousands of people sail from
those countries across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>We speak of North America as Teutonic&mdash;made
prosperous by the stock of northern Europe&mdash;and
South America as Spanish. Latin America, however,
does not all lie south of the Panama Canal. We
must begin to reckon it from the territory line which
separates the United States from Mexico. Southwards
from the banks of the Rio Grande the Latin
tongue is spoken, chiefly Spanish, but with much
Portuguese in Brazil, and Italian in places right
down, through the Torrid Zone, the heavy tropics,
reeking with luxuriant vegetation, to the bleak and
rocky, inhospitable Tierra del Fuego.</p>

<p>There are millions of Latins. They have set up
half a score of Republican governments. The wealthy
world slowly and then impetuously realised the
possibilities of this strangely diversified region.
Untold gold has been poured forth to develop it
and get quick return.</p>

<p>It is not stories of treasure which bring a glint
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
into the eye of modern men. It is enterprise and
development which appeal. There are cattle to be
reared on the ranches of Mexico; there is rubber in
Peru; there are nitrates and fabulous mineral
wealth in Chili and the neighbouring lands; there
are cotton and sugar and coffee in the mighty sweep
of Brazil; there are the illimitable wheat areas of
Argentina, and cattle rearing and the giant possibilities
in supplying Europe with frozen meat; there
is the opening up of immense areas by networks of
railroads.</p>

<p>"The stuff is there; it has only to be got,"
says the man who knows and talks with the fire of
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>South America is not the land of the future. It is
the land of to-day. Nowhere in the world is the
speculator, the investor, more busy than in Latin
America. The tales told by the first Spaniards are
baby talk to the stories told to-day by those who
have been and seen and are fascinated. Of course
it is overdone. Of course there is exaggeration. Of
course some of the jewels in El Dorado are useless
stones. Of course some of the caves of Aladdin are
found empty. But what the modern world ranks
as precious is in abundance.</p>

<p>I like to conjure a contrast between the little
barques of a few hundred tonnage bobbing on unknown
seas with the big fifteen-thousand tonners which make
their ports of call according to time-table. The early
invaders went into the unknown, crept along unmapped
coasts, battled with savages, and died like
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
flies before the scourge of fever. The whole story
of the conquest and settlement of the Americas is
one of slow victory through a mist of tragedy. The
invaders of other days left their native lands with
little hope to return. The invaders of to-day set
forth waving an au revoir to their friends on the
dock side.</p>

<p>The man with the flimsiest imagination can
think of the tiny craft, ill-lit, ill-furnished, with
scurvy-providing food, running before the trade
winds, lolling with idle sails in the doldrums, and
with uncertainty as constant companion. To-day
the huge vessels scorn the tides. Aflame with electric
light they press through the dusk, and the ship's
orchestra plays ragtime music. You cross the
Equator to the tune of a Gaiety light opera. Sultry
afternoons are relieved with exhilarating deck sports.
The warmth of the dinner hour is softened by the
whirl of electric fans. In the evening a space on
deck is enclosed and hung with the flags of all the
nations, and dancers in fancy dress whirl blithely on
the powdered floor. These are the circumstances of
the modern invasion. The journey is a holiday
with nothing of grim adventure about it.</p>

<p>What Latin America means to-day is told in the
personalities of the passengers. There are the rich
Argentines, after six months in Europe, returning to
Buenos Aires, occupying the cabins de luxe. They
offer you the information how much they are paying,
contribute largely to the sports fund, and their
ladies dress with frank display. Whether Spanish
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
or English they are proud of the name of Argentine,
and never weary telling of the progress of their country.
They have open contempt for their Portuguese
neighbours in Brazil. The wealthy Brazilian men,
swarthy and fat and bejewelled, do not join the deck
games, but, with cigar between lips, saunter the decks,
leering at every woman with a passable countenance.
The Argentines thank God there is no nigger
blood in their veins. The Brazilians retaliate they
could buy the Argentines up. Care must be taken
not to mix the two nationalities at the ship's tables.
Each nation sports its own flag. Sometimes rivalry
threatens tragedy.</p>

<p>There is the Englishman "with interests in
Argentina" going out to look after his property,
frequently an <i>estancia</i>, or ranch, purchased when
land was cheap, and before the boom came. Now a
railway cuts through his property, and it has increased
seventy-fold in value. Sometimes he mentions
drought; occasionally he shudders at the mention
of locusts. But he recalls the state of things when
he went out thirty or forty years ago "with not
much more than a bob," and now he has a fortune
made out of meat shipped to Europe, and his only
regret seems to be the iniquitous amount of death
duties which will have to be paid by his heirs.</p>

<p>"Argentina is not what it was," he tells you.
That means the winning of a fortune is going to be
increasingly harder to this and subsequent generations.
But he is a fine type of Englishman, for he
went forth before South America had grown beyond
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
its monthly revolution, when the continent chiefly
bred restlessness amongst the Spanish settlers, and
when life and prosperity was a gamble. He has
come through the fire. Foresight, daring, and good
luck have swung him, as they have swung thousands
of others, into affluence. He has "retired." He
lives at home in Belgravia, and gives fine dinner
parties. But he keeps an eye on Argentine stock,
and when you encounter him in the club he
repeats that "Argentina is not what it was, but
still&mdash;&mdash;" and then he makes you wish you could
place your hand on some of the plums that
remain.</p>

<p>There is the rich Argentine who shows what he
is made of by insisting upon everybody in the smoking-room
drinking champagne at his expense&mdash;and he
is uncomplimentary if anybody deliberately refuses
his hospitality. There is the man who hires a band
to play to him during the voyage. There is the
delicate lady who has a special cow on board so that
she may be sure of fresh milk. The boat carries a
cow so that the children may have milk. The charge
per pint for the milk is high. "Why," said one
passenger when he heard what the price was, "I
think I will give my children champagne; it will
be cheaper."</p>

<p>British gold has flowed like water into South
America to make the dormant region fruitful. British
interests are colossal. The United States has not
taken much of a hand in development, partly because
the Latins do not love their northern neighbours,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
and partly because the financiers of the States have
been sufficiently occupied in their own country.
Three hundred million British pounds sterling has
been invested in Argentine railway and tramway
companies, and there are on board men who manage
the lines&mdash;tall, stalwart, clear-skinned Englishmen,
with cool nerve and steady eye.</p>

<p>There are the big <i>estancia</i> men, proud and
ambitious, who pay enormous prices for famous
race-horses and get the best breeding stock from
home in cattle and sheep, no matter what competition
forces the price up to. There are shrewd
men going out on behalf of syndicates to throw their
eyes round the country and scent out possibilities
for money-making on the grand scale. In the free
talk of the smoking-room they speak with vagueness
of what their special mission is. There are the
men who have been charged to take control of city
development schemes&mdash;for all ports, towns, and
cities in South America are crazy for development,
and are piling their backs with debt to achieve their
desires. There are the men who represent English
firms who are intent on extending their connections
or in establishing branches. There are engineers,
with jobs in the far interior, proceeding to fill five-year
contracts. There are young bank clerks, flushed
with increased salary, exchanging London for a
pampa town and scarcely realising they will find
living three times as expensive as at Bromley. There
are the men who laughingly acknowledge they have
no direct mission except that they intend to see what
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
they can pick up. But they are mostly a good brand
of Briton, well set, and with courage in the veins.
And when one remembers the growing Latin population,
and listens to captivating explanations about
potentialities and hears what has been accomplished&mdash;more
wonderful in the making of cities
than a tale out of the Thousand and One Nights&mdash;there
is the fact in the background that all this
continent must long have continued to lie undeveloped
if it had not been for the constant and confident
inflow of British money.</p>

<p>Beyond the rails are the second-class passengers,
folk of humbler aim, but going to play their part
in the land of adventure. But, above all, are the
third class, the steerage&mdash;few British here&mdash;travelling
to South America with little but hope and muscle
to do the labourer's part. It is labour the country
needs to-day more than capital. In the spring of
the southern hemisphere the Atlantic is trailed with
ships packed with Italians, Spaniards, and Portuguese.
The continent swallows them. They are men
of courage, or they would never have gone forth.
They take with them their fiery Latin temperament
and fierce political, frequently anarchist views. The
native Indians are mostly too cow-like to be of much
use in industry. The millions of negroes in tropical
Brazil are too lazy to be relied upon. Labour is the
need, the ever-pressing need. Emissaries are busy in
southern Europe booming South America and filling
the boats which sail from Lisbon and Vigo and
Genoa&mdash;chiefly from Genoa, for the Italian is the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
ideal immigrant for a warm clime. He is industrious,
sober, frugal.</p>

<p>All the towns along the South American coastline
have futures. They talk about the future,
always the future, and are preparing for it. Swung
in a basket from the deck of the liner, I boarded a
tug and went ashore at Pernambuco. The buildings
which stood were decrepit, as though erected by
the original Portuguese, like their ramshackle homes
on the other side of the ocean, and they had done
nothing to them since except an occasional smear
of pink, blue or yellow colour-wash. Most of the place
was in ruins; whole streets were literally choked
with débris, suggesting there had been a frightful
earthquake, or that a revolutionary episode had
perpetrated dire havoc. In fact, Pernambuco was
in the throes of improvement. The first necessity
of all these South American towns is not a system
of drainage but an Avenida&mdash;a wide main thoroughfare
with bedizened buildings on either side, and
cafés and bands and electric lights and motor-cars
and a theatre. They have begun with a theatre.
But the ways of Western civilisation have travelled
so far because, instead of drama and opera being
presented, the theatre is devoted to kinema entertainments.</p>

<p>As though cleared with a hundred cannon, there
is a way right through the town; this is where the
Avenida is to be. Open matchbox tramcars, drawn
by weedy mules, rumble over uneven metals. The
next time, however, I visit Pernambuco electric cars
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
will whiz along the roads. There are no cabs or
carriages, even of ancient pattern, to be hired; but
there are plenty of motor-cars. There is a breakwater
built on a coral reef; yet huge harbour works
are in progress, and before long liners instead of
lying outside will be fastened to the dock side. There
are big shops where you can buy most things, including
the inevitable picture post cards, though you pay
twopence each for post cards of a kind which you
can buy for two a penny at home. I paid 1s. 8d.
for a drink for which no hotel at home would have
charged me more than 6d. The neighbourhood is
rich in vegetation, but potatoes and fruits are imported
from Portugal. The people are town proud. They
are proud of Brazil. The Brazilian flag, with its
yellow ground and star-spangled blue globe in the
centre, waves everywhere.</p>

<p>The next day we were at Bahia, picturesquely
reclining on a wooded hill. It used to be the great
port in the slave trade, and most of the inhabitants
are negroes. Indeed, it must not be forgotten that
most of the population are negroes, or negro Indians,
or negro Portuguese, or a mixture of all three. However,
it is only the Portuguese, a mere handful in the
total, who exercise political influence in the country.
On the boat came many Bahians. All down the
coast, whilst we were losing the European invaders,
we were taking on board and losing Brazilians. Most
of them were podgy, and an inky tinge on their
skins indicated there was mixture in their blood.</p>

<p>The healthy sports which had entertained the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
English travellers on the Equator were things of the
past. There was a new sport, and it was played in
the smoking-room all day long and far into the night,
when most of us had gone to bed. The rattle of the
dice-box never ceased. Gambling was in the veins,
and the English sovereign was constantly shuffled
from hand to hand on the green baize tables. There
was baccarat, first for low stakes and then for high.
There were two glib Yankee-Negro-Spaniards who
had such luck that spectators shrugged shoulders
and exchanged glances. In a single game they
netted £150, and one young Englishman was a loser
by £80.</p>

<p>From gambling at the tables one turned to talking
about gambling in the country. The enormous
liabilities to foreign countries are all incurred in a
great gamble that the hinterlands will yield produce
which will pay for all and leave massive surpluses.
The coffee trade of Brazil is immense. But all
merchants do not make their incomes by watching
and nursing the market. That is too slow. Transactions
are decided quite as often by the throw of
the dice as by negotiation and bargaining. Reckless,
far removed from business principles, all this
is; but it bespeaks a buoyancy of belief that, notwithstanding
the lapse of luck, there is a bottomless
well of prosperity to be dipped into in the natural
productions of the country. It is scarcity which
breeds timidity; it is the confidence of affluence
which occasions waste.</p>

<p>Of course there was much talk about Rio de
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Janeiro, the city with the most gorgeous setting in
the southern hemisphere.</p>

<p>"Rio harbour is the most beautiful in the world,"
said the Brazilian.</p>

<p>"It cannot be a patch on Sydney harbour," said
the Australian, who had never seen Rio.</p>

<p>"Tut!" said the Brazilian, who had never seen
Sydney.</p>

<p>It was in the fall of an exquisite Sunday afternoon
that our glasses caught sight of the hills around
Rio. As we approached and ran past picturesque
islands a wonderful panorama was unfolded. The
scenery was unlike any other scenery in the world.
The hills, radiant with equatorial vegetation, rose like
strange humps out of the sea. In the background
giant mountains reared their heads in the crimson-grey
clouds of approaching evening. The picture
was not like real scenery. It was like the
realisation of a disordered imagination. I would say
it was like an imitation of Turner, were the illustration
not so trite. Then I thought there was something
Chinese about the outreness of the landscape. Then
the sun went down in a hurry, and the background
was a weird purple. The ship dropped anchor, and
the front part of Rio town, a tumble of fantastic red
and yellow washed houses, was for all the world like
a drop curtain to a stage. I felt we had slipped into
another world&mdash;and I am not given to rhapsody.</p>

<p>A thousand lamps began to blink along the
esplanade which curves to the bend of the bay. A
thousand lights pricked the hill sides. There were
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
two big black Brazilian warships, and somebody
had to tell the old story how two battleships were
sent out to visit the Brazilian convict island in the
Atlantic, and how one returned with the awful story
that the island had disappeared, for they sailed
straight for it and it had gone, whilst later on it was
learnt that the other vessel had certainly found the
island, for it got piled up on the rocks. Gaily illuminated
launches scurried about whilst our liner was
slowly being berthed alongside the quay.</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried the Brazilian to me, whilst his
eyes glowed brightly, "say that Rio is the most
lovely harbour in the world!"</p>

<p>"There's nothing to shout about," interrupted the
Australian, "alongside Sydney harbour; and you've
seen Sydney harbour," he added, turning to me.</p>

<p>As a sort of amateur Solomon, I was turned to
for judgment. My first comment was to laugh. I
had seen the two harbours which are each claimed by
their champions to be the grandest thing Nature has
ever accomplished. It was amusing to witness the
fervour of the two men, as though they had a hand
in the making of these famous harbours. They were
both of the stuff which leads men to believe that
for any other country to have pretensions to beauty
is just dull-witted boastfulness.</p>

<p>"Well," I remarked, "I think Vigo harbour is
charming."</p>

<p>"Oh, Vigo!" they both exclaimed in disgust.</p>

<p>"And there is something to be said for the
Golden Gate leading to San Francisco," I added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"But the Golden Gate and any other place is
not in the same street with Sydney harbour," blurted
the Australian rather angrily, though he had never
seen the Golden Gate. "It cannot be," he said
decisively.</p>

<p>"But what do you really think of Rio compared
with Sydney?" asked the Brazilian, who saw I was
attempting to be funny at the expense of them both.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," I said, actually throwing half a
cigar overboard, for I was called upon to give a verdict
on one of the most debatable subjects in the
world. "It is like passing judgment on two lovely
women. For grand, impressive spectacular effect,
being hit right between the eyes with stupendous
gorgeousness, seeing Rio harbour at the hour of
sunset is the most wonderful sight in the world."</p>

<p>The Brazilian smiled, and the Australian made
a contemptuous noise with his lips.</p>

<p>"But hold," I added. "You see all the beauty
of Rio harbour at one view. It is like suddenly
coming face to face with an imperial lady of dazzling
attractions. When you have seen her you have seen
everything. Sydney harbour does not knock you
over with bewilderment of beauty like Rio does.
It is more calm, less turbulent; it impresses you.
The more you know it the more it impresses you. And
it has lovely arms, stretching up between soft woodlands,
as peaceful as the best bits of the Thames.
Rio has nothing like that. No, no; I'm not competent
to pass judgment. You two gentlemen can
go on fighting over the matter, as I dare say the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
people of your two countries will continue to do,
till the crack of doom. I admit the unrivalled
grandeur of Rio, but personally I have more affection
for the grace and the delights of Sydney."</p>

<p>The Brazilian bowed politely. The Australian
wanted to argue I had ceded too much to Rio.
Happily, just then a group of friends came on board
to rush me off to a dinner party on shore.</p>

<p>Rio will always remind me of Imre Kiralfy, the
White City, and Earl's Court. There are some narrow,
old European-like streets that recall places on the
other side of the Atlantic: the houses high and
sombre and with a little mystery behind the shutters.
But most of Rio is rampantly new and garish. The
people have driven a magnificent Avenida right
through the heart of the city, and hang the expense!
The piles of buildings, hotels, public offices, great
stores along this Avenida are generally eccentric in
architecture&mdash;and there comes the feeling that here
these transplanted Latins, with a strain of negro in
their veins, are struggling to express themselves as
a new people. The wonderful thing is that five
years ago this Avenida was not.</p>

<p>Nothing that the Riviera has can outvie the
esplanade, broad, well made, with miles of bright
gardens and statues&mdash;and the motor-cars whiz along
at the maddest, breakneck pace. There is one exquisite
avenue lined with nothing but palm trees.
Many of the houses, designed surely by someone who
has built palaces for pantomimes, are half buried
behind splashes of prodigal tropical vegetation.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Everything is ornate, showy. From the standpoint
of British comfort the buildings are gaudy palaces,
lacking real ease. But always one has to remember
one is in the tropics.</p>

<p>I know no place so dazzling as Rio. Behind all
the glitter, however, there is gold. There is commerce,
abounding speculation, the devil-may-care
assurance of the gambler. Broad ways, electric car
services, hundreds of expensive motor-cars, extravagant
restaurants, ladies laden with jewels, the men
eager, all tell the opening chapter in the story of
Brazil's future. In the cool Strangers' Club I met
men of the Saxon breed, quiet Englishmen, quiet
Americans, representatives of syndicates with millions
of money at their backs, negotiating, wire-pulling,
securing concessions for railroads, for developing
stretches of that great back country of Brazil, as
little explored as Central Africa, but the possibilities
of which the world is realising and will scramble
hungrily to turn into profit. What Brazil has
accomplished so far is but the turning of the key
in the door.</p>

<p>The morning comes with a gasp, and a flavour
of old oil is in the air. The heavy stillness makes
one recite the agony of the Ancient Mariner. We
are leaving the ocean, and the steamer is churning
a way up an ochreish river, banked on one side,
but with a stretch of malarious jungle on the other.
We are making for Santos, and an old German
who rests his elbows on the rail tells how he has
known this coast for thirty years, and how, in the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
old days, it reeked with yellow fever; how whole
ships' crews went down before the scourge, and how
no passenger boats dared lie at Santos for the night,
but always slipped down to the mouth of the river
in the evening so that fresh air could be obtained.</p>

<p>Now drainage has done wonders, and Santos, a
great export town for Brazilian coffee, is improving
itself. I get into conversation with the man who
has been engaged to settle in Santos and see that
the place is improved. The river is deep, serviceable,
and runs far inland. Casting my eye over the flat
lands, matted with vegetation, and dotted with many
a wretched nigger shanty, I have a vision of the
time when docks will be delved and many of the
riches of Brazil will find their outlet to the world
by this gateway. Great wharves are on the river
front at Santos.</p>

<p>The town, however, is in a hugger-mugger of
change. The Brazilians seem to lounge round, but
they are forging for the future. Men who have been
with us for a fortnight hasten ashore. They have
eagerness. They are off by the quaint hill-climbing
railway to San Paulo, high perched, healthy, throbbing
with trade. Others are bent for the interior,
away from their kind, to seek their fortunes.</p>

<p>"And that's the end of my six months' leave,"
says a red-faced Englishman with a sorrowful smile.
"I lived away back there for three years, and never
saw or talked to another Englishman. I've been
home for my holiday, and now it will be another
three years before I come back from the plantations.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Good-bye. I'll hunt you up when I'm in London
again." Off he goes&mdash;one of the brave men of the
world.</p>

<p>A peep at Monte Video, the neat capital of the
miniature Republic of Uruguay, and then the black-green
of the ocean we have been travelling for three
weeks is left behind, and we are forcing a way up
the yellow waters of the River Plate. A river; but
for hours there is no land in sight, so wide is the
mouth of this great stream. And shallow, for at
intervals the steamer shivers as she bumps on the
bottom.</p>

<p>"That is all right," says the captain, "for we
do not mind a couple of feet of mud."</p>

<p>The journey of the new adventurers is nearing its
end. Shipboard friendships are sworn to be eternal.
The ship's sports are long over, and the prizes have
been distributed. The fancy dress ball on deck is
a memory. There is the distribution of largesse
amongst those who have made things pleasant.
Cabin passengers are light-hearted. The throng of
Spaniards and Italians in the steerage are silent and
strangely impressed. They were sad when they left
the old lands; they were happy during the voyage;
now the mystery of the unknown is laying hold of
them. We pass a crowded emigrant ship from Italy,
and cheers are exchanged.</p>

<p>Out of the haze of the hot day rises the low land,
Argentina. We see the buildings of La Plata, once
intended to be the capital of the country. The ship
makes strange zigzags, for it is following a channel
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
known only to the pilot. There rises a bank of
smoke. As we get nearer we run into shipping.
From the background emerge tall buildings, white
mostly, and recalling the skyscrapers of the United
States. So slowly, laboriously, the good ship <i>Avon</i>,
which has behaved so well, is brought to rest in
front of Buenos Aires. It is night, but the wharves
are all commotion. There is the shrieking of tugs.
There is the shout of excited Argentines, but their
garb is south European. Beyond the Custom House
can be seen hastening motor-cars and whizzing
electric tramcars. And here is a newspaper man,
wanting an interview. We are entering "the amazing
Argentine."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<h3>SOME ASPECTS OF BUENOS AIRES</h3>


<p>The Argentines call their city of Buenos Aires the
Paris of the southern hemisphere. It has a population
nearing a million and a half, which is greater
than that of any other town below the line of the
Equator. The people promise that in time it will
overtake London.</p>

<p>You insult an Argentine if you mix him up with
Chilians, Brazilians, and other South Americans. He
does not thank you for being reminded his father
sailed from Italy, or his grandfather from Spain. He
has no affection for any old land from which his
sires came. The beginning of the world for Argentina
was in May, 1810, when the Republic was set up.</p>

<p>He has no pride of historic race. When he makes
money and visits Europe it is not to find the
ancestral home in Spain or Italy. It is to have a
good time in Paris. When he takes his family to
Paris it is not to spend three, five, or six months. It
is to spend three, five, or six hundred thousand
pesos&mdash;and the value of a peso is one shilling and
eightpence. When the pesos have flown he returns
to Argentina and makes more.</p>

<p>The Argentines are a dignified people. They
accept the English because in round figures five
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
hundred millions of British capital in gold have
aided in developing the country. They dislike the
citizen of the United States because the big brother
Republic of the north patronises them, and they need
nobody's help. They have a contempt for all other
Latins beneath the Isthmus of Panama, particularly
the Brazilians. They are conscious of their own
qualities.</p>

<p>And the visitor blinks, and rubs his eyes, and
admits the wonders of Argentina. If his acquaintance
with geography is casual he has shrugged
his shoulders at South American Republics, where
they have revolutions every six weeks, and where
tawny Spaniards in quaint costumes drive mules
and die from difference of opinion with other
Spaniards.</p>

<p>Then he goes to "B.A."&mdash;the familiar description
of Buenos Aires&mdash;and he finds he has landed in a
rampantly modern American-cum-European city.
There is none of the sloth of the Southern, no checking
of business between noon and three to pass in
siestas.</p>

<p>It is a busy city. The port is thronged with
shipping, mostly British. High-shouldered elevators
stick out long tongues, and streams of wheat, grown
on the plains of the interior, pour food for Europe
into the holds. Trucks of cattle grunt through the
noisy railway yards. There are huge killing establishments,
and animals go to their death by the many
thousand every day with a celerity which would
awaken a Chicagoan. There are mighty avenues
of chilled and frozen meat. Labour-saving machinery
carries it on board the steamers which hasten across
the Atlantic, carrying cheap beef to the London
and Liverpool markets. Commerce is conducted on
the latest scientific lines. The North Americans
have nobbled the meat trade, and the Jews have
control of the wheat market.</p>

<p>Buenos Aires is the mart where the produce of
the rich back-lands is bartered. It levies a heavy
toll. The most imposing business buildings are the
banks&mdash;national banks, British, German, French,
Spanish, and Italian banks. In and about Reconquista
are these banks, ever busy. Near by are the
rival shipping offices, a glut of them. The offices
of the great railway companies are enormous. Wide-spreading
premises exhibit the latest and best agricultural
machinery that Lincolnshire and Illinois can
produce. There is the hustle of commerce. The
streets are as narrow and as crowded and as vital
as within the City of London. There is earnestness
about the men.</p>

<p>The Argentine is sombre in manner. He dresses
in conventional black. A light waistcoat, a gay tie
or fancy socks, is bad form. You cannot tell the
difference between a millionaire and one of his clerks,
except that the former has an expensive motor-car
and the latter hires a taxi or a victoria, or travels
by electric tramcar. At every corner you see evidence
of prosperity, of successful money-making. And
money speaks in "B.A." as loudly as it does in
New York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>Folk of the Saxon breed tend to scoff at the decadence
of the Latin race. But there is something
revivifying in the transplanting of a people. We have
evidence in our own colonies. The man of Spanish
descent in the Argentine is not always the spry fellow
he thinks himself; but he has dropped the cloak of
sluggishness which enwraps Spain. He is often rich;
he lives in a gorgeous residence; his extravagances
are beyond those of a Russian archduke. He is
polite and hospitable.</p>

<p>But the wealthy Spanish Argentine is not the
creator of his own wealth. I heard of only one case
of a Spanish Argentine owing his great fortune to
commercial enterprise. The fortunes of most of these
Argentines come from land. Their grandfathers got
immense areas by the easiest means. Properties were
so enormous that extent was not reckoned in acres,
or even square miles, but by leagues. But a hundred
leagues, however good for cattle or sheep, or wheat
growing&mdash;what was its value a couple of hundred
miles from a port? Then came British railways.
They pierced the prairies. The land bounded in
value, tenfold, a thousandfold. Other people came
in; first shrewd Scotsmen; then industrious Italians;
then Englishmen bent on becoming <i>estancieros</i>. Their
children are Argentines. But the mighty fortunes
are mostly in the possession of the early Argentines&mdash;those
who were settled fifty and more years ago.
They have sat still and seen their land blossom in
value. They pay no income tax; there is no tax
on unearned increment. Mr. Lloyd George was once
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
in the Argentine, associated with a land development
company. That, however, is another story.</p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of immigrants pour into
the Republic every year. They come from every
land on earth. Mostly do they come from Spain and
Italy. Italy provides the greatest number, and
splendid colonists they are. Though the language
will always be Spanish, the race is rapidly becoming
Italianised. There is a commingling of the sterner
stuff from Europe. So in this rich land&mdash;rivalling
Canada and Australia in productiveness&mdash;there is
being blended a new people, keen, alert, successful,
ostentatious, pagan&mdash;a people that has a destiny
and knows it.</p>

<p>The Argentines are town proud. You are not in
Buenos Aires a couple of days before you are bombarded
with the inquiry, "Don't you think this is
a beautiful city?" It is not that; but it is an
interesting city.</p>

<p>In the oldest quarters the streets are narrow,
after the Spanish style. So narrow are they that,
with electric cars jingling along them, vehicles are
allowed to journey only one way. To reach a shop
by carriage it is sometimes necessary to drive along
three and a half sides of a block of buildings. Funny
little policemen, brown faced, blue clad, and with
white gaiters and white wands, direct the traffic.
In the Florida&mdash;the Bond Street of "B.A."&mdash;all
wheeled traffic is prohibited between the hours of
four and seven in the afternoon, so that shoppers
may have an easier way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Most of the streets are called after Argentine
provinces, or neighbouring republics, or national
heroes, or some politician or rich man who can
influence the authorities. When a popular man has
lost his popularity the remnant of his fame is obliterated
by the street called after him being named after
someone else. It is as though the Government at home
decided to change Victoria Street, Westminster, into
the Avenida Asquith, with the prospect of its being
altered later on to the Calle Bonar Law.</p>

<p>Wide plazas decorate the city. Vegetation is
luxuriant, and statues are numerous. The Plaza
Mayo is not called after an Irish peer, but after the
month of May, 1810. The shops are as big as those
in London. Argentina manufactures practically
nothing, and all the lovely things have to be imported
from Europe. The hotels are imitations of those
in Paris. The restaurants are on a par with the best
we have in London. A Viennese band plays whilst
you have Russian caviare and the waiter is asking
your choice in champagne. But everything is expensive.
A man needs three times the salary in
Buenos Aires to live the same way he would live
in London. If you calculate exchange rates you
go mad. It is best to count the peso (1s. 8d.) as a
shilling, and then remember that you are spending
your shilling in South America, where things are
dear. You can get a modest luncheon for 10s.;
but you will pay 2s. for a bottle of beer, and 3s. 6d.
for a cigar worth smoking.</p>

<p>Yet nobody minds. Immense sums are being
spent on improving the city. It is built on the
American T-square plan. But it is to be subjected
to the plan of Haussmann, with great tree-girt
avenues radiating diagonally from the Plaza Mayo.
An underground railway, honeycombing beneath the
town, is in rapid construction. The railways have a
great suburban traffic, and are being electrified.
There are British colonies at Belgrano and Hurlingham,
and you have a choice of three golf courses. In
the summer months&mdash;December, January, and February&mdash;there
is river life on the Tigre, the Thames of
the Argentine. A charming spot is Palermo, a combination
of Hyde Park and the Bois de Boulogne&mdash;open
sweeps and charming trees, a double boulevard
with statues and commemorative marbles in
the middle, well-cared-for gardens, radiant flowers
and the band playing.</p>

<p>A drive through Palermo at the fashionable hour
causes one to gasp at the thought that one is six
thousand miles from Europe. Nowhere in the world
have I seen such a display of expensive motor-cars,
thousands of them. Ostentation is one of the stars
of life in the Argentine. Appearances count for everything.
You must have a motor-car, even though you
have not the money to pay for it, and you owe the
landlord of your flat a year's rent. The ladies are
exquisitely gowned, but they have not the vivacity
of the French women nor their daring in dress. There
is a demureness, a restraint which reminds one that
the atmosphere of far-away Castile is still upon
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>On Sundays and Thursdays there are races at
Palermo. The price Argentines pay for horseflesh
has become a proverb. It is a good race-course. We
have nothing in England, neither at Epsom, Ascot,
nor Goodwood, so magnificent as the grand stand.
It is a glorified royal box. The restaurant is like
the Ritz dining-room. Everybody dresses as they
would at Ascot. There are no bookmakers. The
totalisator is used. Betting is officially conducted
by the Jockey Club, and there is constant announcement
of the amount of money put on the horses.
Those who have backed the winners share the spoil,
less ten per cent. As this ten per cent. is deducted
from the total amount put on each race, the income
of the Jockey Club runs into hundreds of thousands
of pounds. So the Club maintains a good race-course,
offers capital prizes, has a house in "B.A."&mdash;undoubtedly
the most palatial club-house in the
southern world&mdash;and distributes the remainder
amongst the hospitals. The income of the Jockey
Club is so large it is really embarrassing. The
members are proceeding to build an Aladdin's palace
of super-gorgeousness.</p>

<p>But at the races at Palermo I noticed that no
ladies attended, except in the members' enclosure.
Even there they did not mingle with the men-folk.
There was no mirth, such as we are used to in Europe.
They kept themselves to little groups. Moving from
wonder to wonder, I was present at a gala performance
at the Colon Theatre. I have seen all the great
theatres in the world, and this is the loveliest&mdash;a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
harmony of rose and gold. The audience was as
fashionably dressed as at the opera in London,
though I missed the dazzling display of diamonds
which had been promised. Most of the audience
were ladies; there were boxes of them, and most
of the men were in the stalls. There was one gallery
reserved for women.</p>

<p>I began to discern a strange Orientalism in the
relations between the sexes. The Argentine women
are amongst the best mothers in the world. But
there is practically none of the good fellowship
between young fellows and young girls which is so
happy a feature of our English life. For a man and
a woman to take a walk together would shock the
proprieties. There are brilliant receptions, but dinner
parties, as we know them, are rare. An Argentine
seldom introduces a friend to his wife. Except
amongst the poorest a woman scarcely ever goes
into the streets alone. If she does she runs risk of
being insulted. There are Argentines, who would
be offended if refused the name of gentlemen, who
think it excellent sport to walk in the Florida in the
evening and mutter obscenities to every unprotected
woman who passes. Buenos Aires is the most immoral
city in the world. So the Argentine guards his
women-folk from contact with other men. His attitude
is a relic of the days when the Moors had possession
of Spain.</p>

<p>I have called Buenos Aires a pagan city. So it is.
The men are frankly irreligious. In conversation I
have been told of the tolerance to all religions.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
What is really meant is indifference to any
religion.</p>

<p>Money-making and flamboyant display&mdash;these are
the gods which are worshipped. The houses in the
wealthier districts are exotic in architecture. I remember
driving along the Avenida Alvear, a street
of palaces, reminiscent of the Grand Canal at Venice
if it were a roadway. But the fine stone blocks are
nothing but stucco. The ornamentation, the floral
decorations, are not carved stone; they are stucco.
Imitation, pretence, showiness, the flaunting of wealth,
are everywhere.</p>

<p>Yet this city, which has grown in a generation
on the muddy flats by the side of the muddy Parana
River, has something that is weird in its fascination.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<h3>ROUND AND ABOUT THE CAPITAL</h3>


<p>The way not to see a city is to be trotted round
and shown all the "sights." I have an idea I may
have missed some of the "sights" of Buenos Aires.
I did not "do" the churches. Acquaintances who
knew I went to South America to pursue my trade
of writer sometimes asked me what I was going
to write about, and the reply was, "I do not know."
But I was not believed.</p>

<p>Anyway, I may say that I drifted about "B.A."
I presented my letters of introduction, made friends,
lunched out and dined out, had motor trips, went
here and there as suggestion provided the inclination;
maybe to a theatre, or to smoke a cigar in
one of the clubs with men who are of account in
Argentina or no account at all, or to spend a Sunday
with an Argentine family; maybe to idle an hour
in one of the cafés; maybe to have a serious talk
with a Minister; maybe do nothing but idle round.
That is no scientific way to study a city. But it
just happens to be my way.</p>

<p>The conclusions I draw may be wrong, for I may
have met the wrong people and seen the wrong things,
especially as I had no system. Yet out of the confused
jumble of impressions and experiences something
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
coherent evolves, and that is the substance of
my remarks when I am asked, "Well, what do you
think about Buenos Aires?"</p>

<p>It is not my wish to accentuate the point, but
open-handed extravagance is one of the traits of
the people. It is a fault of democratic countries
that, having no aristocracy of birth, they proceed
to create one of wealth. Argentina has fine old
Spanish families; but, though esteemed, they are
in the background. In the wrangle-jangle of frenzied
progress they are not to be counted amongst the
moderns. So garish is the display of money that
the idea left is that you have had your attention
called to it by the constant blaring of a bugle.</p>

<p>But I would shrink from saying the display is
vulgar. Keeping in mind that the people are Latins,
and are fonder of colour than we of the cold and
moral north, I would write there is a sort of ostentatious
restraint. Argentines glory in spending money,
but amongst the older settled people other things
besides money have their place. They are fond of
music, and pride themselves that they discovered
Tetrazzini and Kubelik long before London. Here,
as in Paris, London, and New York, there is the
mob which goes to the opera because it is "the
thing" to have an expensive box, and to wear lovely
gowns and loads of diamonds. The prices paid make
the charges for a gala night at Covent Garden seem
like those of a twopenny show. It may be said that
a well-known artiste is sure of a kindly reception.
Yet Buenos Aires has its moods; it has its vagaries,
and is petulant. For some undefinable reason it
will take a dislike to some performer who arrives
with a European reputation. Perhaps half a dozen
ladies who lead the fashionable world will say the
artiste is overrated. "She may be all right for
Paris, but she does not come up to Buenos Aires
standard"&mdash;that is the attitude. For anybody to
praise the poor singer after that is to advertise their
inartistic taste. There is a boycott. So a European
singer or instrumentalist who goes to the Argentine
aglow with the prospect of a dazzling success sometimes
returns with the saddest of experiences&mdash;neglect.</p>

<p>With such a people, Latin in race and living in
the sunshine, life is something of a holiday. One
hears stories of the looseness of life amongst the
men&mdash;on the boats running between France and
Argentina can be seen the girls going out to meet
the requirements of the hundreds of houses of ill-fame&mdash;but
the Argentine women themselves are
beyond reproach. Indeed, their regard for correctness
is often amusingly prudish. Public opinion is
so strong that no lady, if she wants the esteem of
her neighbours, dare show the slightest originality
in costume or conduct. Plays with the faintest
hint of suggestiveness about them are barred. Performances
which would pass muster in a London
West-end theatre are shunned; plays to which the
most innocent of girls cannot go are taboo. The
consequence of this is that there are other places of
amusement especially catering for men, which no
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
respectable woman can enter. Just outside the
boundaries there are cinematograph shows "for
men only," which for indecency cannot be outdone
in Port Said or Havana.</p>

<p>I have mentioned how the visitor to Argentina
soon begins to be aware of the low position of women
in the minds of men, the way in which there is no
real friendship between the sexes outside the family
circle, and how no Argentine will trust another
Argentine in regard to his ladies. With all their
finery and jewellery and expensive motor-cars and
boxes at the Colon Theatre, you are prone to remark,
"How un-European!" when you see the segregation
of the women.</p>

<p>Yet with all their frivolity, dress, bridge, amusements,
you make a mistake if you fancy the Argentine
lady a guarded, slothful doll&mdash;though the description
applies in thousands of cases. I had the opportunity
of seeing the other side of the picture. On
two days, under the guidance of ladies themselves,
I visited the establishments of Las Damas da Beneficencia
and several Government hospitals. A noble
work is being done. I saw how the poor are cared
for. There was the nurturing of the old. There was
tending the sick in buildings worthy of any city in
the world. There were the homes where the wives
of poor folk could come to bring their babies into
the world. There is much illegitimacy, and formerly
there was much infanticide. So there was a kind
of casement where, at dusk, mothers could bring
their unwanted offspring and deliver them. No
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
questions were asked, but the infant, because it
was a helpless little child, was cared for. The same
work is done to-day, but without the mystery of
the casement. Foster-mothers are engaged to nurse
the children. As one went through the rooms, and
saw the tiny morsels of humanity, many of them
feeble, with a shape of head which roused wonder
as to the future, it was hard to keep the tears away.</p>

<p>Poverty, as we understand it in Europe, does
not exist in Argentina. But there are men who are
stricken down in early manhood, unable to earn anything,
and who need help. There are widows and
the fatherless to be cared for. There are poor folk,
but their trouble is due to misfortune and not to
economic causes. Charity, however, is great, and
funds are numerous and the Government provides
handsomely, and there is no distress such as we
know it. But all this good work, hospitals, looking
after the aged, providing for the fatherless, is carried
on by the women of Argentina. Except to serve
as doctors, no men have any voice in the control or
management. Ladies, with their presidents and
boards of management and committees, have the
work placed entirely in their hands. It is set apart
for them, and no man interferes. Yet the suffrage
question has not extended to Argentina.</p>

<p>Life is taken lightly and showily by this new
nation. But when anybody dies all the relatives go
into mourning, to the fourteenth cousin. And in
death the display is just as rampant as in life. The
Recoleta is a strange cemetery, bizarre, ghoulish,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
tawdry. To own a tomb in Recoleta is one of the
necessities if a family wants to be in the swim.
These tombs are like chalets, occasionally of Italian
marble, generally of the Buenos Aires stucco&mdash;the
capital surpasses all other cities in the world
in the amount of stucco&mdash;and they are ornate.
There are streets upon streets of them, and
you take a walk through a town of the dead.
The doors are open, and you can step in and
see half a dozen coffins ranged round the shelves.
Occasionally there are photographs of the dear
departed. On All Saints' Day it is usual for the
living family to gather in the tomb, have tea, and
munch cakes. After a number of years the coffins
have to be removed, or a heavy sum paid, and the
tomb is "to let." The whole thing is repulsive to
the Englishman, but the Argentine loves it.</p>

<p>The capital of Buenos Aires province is La Plata,
about fifty miles away. I went down one day by
the luncheon train, which runs out of the Plaza
Constitution just after midday and does the journey
in an hour. It was a fine train, and the luncheon car
was bigger, and the food better than we have on
English lines. The car was crowded with a sallow-skinned,
black-moustached, black-garbed lot of gentlemen,
and I gathered they were all Government
officials. Nobody in Government employ thinks of
doing any work in the morning. The men go to the
office late and leave early. It was almost like home.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>

<p>La Plata is a town that has missed its way. Full
of grandiose ideas, and taking the United States as
a model, it was decided to build La Plata as the
federal capital on the Washington plan. Gorgeous
buildings were erected; magnificent avenues were
constructed; the loveliest of public gardens were
laid out; a fine museum was founded; a great
municipal theatre was piled up. In the public square
bandstands were provided and statues to national
heroes hoisted. It was to be the flower of Argentine
towns. And every Argentine town, when it
sets out to beautify itself, must have an avenida
and a plaza and an equestrian statue of San
Martin; the matters of water supply and drainage
come later.</p>

<p>But the federal capital absolutely refused to
settle at La Plata. It was too near Buenos Aires,
where society lived, and where there was a whirl of
excitement. So, perforce, the capital had to be
at Buenos Aires, and a Government House for
the residence of the President of the Republic
was built, and is known as the "Palace o
Gold," because of the money consumed in its
construction.</p>

<p>Argentina is ever willing to vote vast sums for
town adornment; but the money has a habit of
evaporating before half the work is done, and then
more is needed.</p>

<p>However, La Plata is the capital of the province
of Buenos Aires; but the majority of officials refuse
to live there. They prefer to come down from
Buenos Aires at a quarter past one, and catch the
quarter to five train back. The Governor has made
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
appeals; he has even threatened what he will do if
the officials do not live in La Plata. They take no
notice. The consequence is that this beautiful city&mdash;and
without doubt it is majestic in its spaciousness&mdash;is
deserted, and a saunter through it is like a walk
through an old cathedral town on a drowsy afternoon.</p>

<p>As a companion and a host no one could be more
charming than the Argentine. He loves his country,
but is willing to hear praise about other countries
without thinking you wish to depreciate Argentina.
He will go to infinite trouble to secure some particular
information you are anxious to possess. Men on
whom I had no personal claim whatever laid aside
their work and devoted a couple of days in my behalf.
As the men are courteous so the women are graceful,
until lack of exercise and over-eating makes them
stout. The girls are modest, but, I am afraid, centre
their thoughts on dress. It rather shocked one to see
that it is a habit for quite young girls of thirteen or
fourteen years to daub their faces with powder. As
for the young gentleman, he begins when twelve
years of age to smoke and to tell lewd stories. He
is impudent to the servants and to his parents, and
I have known fathers smile when told their sons
of fifteen have taken to visiting houses of ill-fame.
Some Argentines are taking to healthy sport; but
it would be better if all of them took to outdoor
exercises, cricket, football, baseball, tennis, and
golf. The Argentine young gentleman is bright but
superficial, and is too fond of the clothes of the
dandy and jewellery and perfumes to excite any
admiration amongst men who dislike effeminacy in
their own sex.</p>

<p>It was my good fortune to receive nothing but
kindness from every class of Argentine that I met.
But I am not going to hide I met Englishmen, who
knew more about the Argentines and who had few
generous things to say. "There is no morality,
unless the young women are guarded; the Argentine
is egotistic beyond words; domestic habits are dirty,
and taking a bath is rare; the men chatter, and,
whilst voluble with friendship, are suspicious; they
are bombastic about patriotism, but are not above
receiving bribes; all the advantages the Argentine
has he owes to foreigners; he produces nothing himself;
he is shallow and shiftless; the only business
instinct he has is cunning, and the old Spanish
<i>mañana</i> spirit&mdash;always putting off till to-morrow the
performance of a business duty&mdash;is deep seated."
All of which shows how impossible it is to draw a
composite picture of an individual to represent a
nation. Just as there are nice Englishmen and
vulgar fellows, cultured Americans and bounders,
delightful Germans and hoggish sots, so in Argentina
it takes all sorts to make a people. The growing
practice of well-to-do Argentines of sending their children
to be educated in Europe has its advantages,
though there is another side of the picture. They
certainly acquire better manners than they pick up
at home; they learn that Argentina is not the
centre of the world. When they return to Argentina
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and display the consequences of foreign travel they
are not popular.</p>

<p>As far as I could discern the Argentine, though
still infused with Latin traits, still showy and talkative,
more inclined to gamble than to do hard work,
is breaking through and away from the old Spanish
habits. European business men told me they were
keen witted, but incompetent in practical affairs.
But there is too much business now going on in
Argentina, too much development of industries in
which foreigners have little hand, too thorough a
grasp of some of the problems which face all new
lands, for the Argentines to be dismissed with a
phrase.</p>

<p>I could see they were inexact, that they were fond
of showing off, that knowledge of the world was
thin; but I did understand their genuine ambition
to lift Argentina into the first rank among nations;
that where they lacked technical and mechanical
knowledge themselves they were willing to let others
come in; that they were quite alive to what progress
means in the modern sense. The conservatism of
the old Spaniard has completely disappeared. The
Argentine wants the latest and the best. If one goes
forth to gather faults it is easy enough to get a basketful.
What drew me, however, was not so much
listening to a catalogue of things he is not, but to
mark down what he is, what he has done and is
doing, and what he intends to do. As a small instance,
in Buenos Aires the habit of the Spanish
siesta is abandoned. There is no pulling down of
business shutters between noon and three o'clock.
The climate is enervating, but be the day never so
steamy, with hot gusts panting from the north, the
city is early alive with commerce, the suburban
trains are packed, the Stock Exchange is a babble
of excitement&mdash;and there never seems to be any
drawing of rein till five or six in the afternoon. There
is hustle.</p>

<p>The way the population jumps up is phenomenal.
It signifies much that an eighth of a million is added
to the population of a capital in a single year. Skyscrapers
now tower over the buildings which were
thought enormous a dozen years ago. Notwithstanding
the services of the policemen directing the
traffic, there is often a tangle of motor-cars, electric
tramcars, private carriages and carts. New broadways
are being driven through the city, and up go
palatial stores. Most English newspapers are modest
in <i>locale</i>. But the Argentine newspapers keep in
the sun. <i>La Prensa</i> is one of the best-informed
journals in the world. It has a noble exterior to its
offices. Inside are luxurious suites of rooms, lecture
halls, libraries, and the public are invited to enter.
Every public building, all the clubs, even the churches,
seem to be tied up with long ropes of different coloured
electric lamps, so that on nights of festival the
switch is jerked and the whole place is radiantly
illuminated.</p>

<p>It is all very wonderful. The confusion, the
barbarism, the love of beauty and the display of
dollars, the inflow of invested gold, the coming of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the immigrant, the whirl of business, the big deals,
the gambling, the making of fortunes and the losing
of fortunes, dazzle the mind. But you feel the
fascination of Buenos Aires. It has grown so
astonishingly in so short a time that you gasp when
you contemplate how much more it is likely to
grow.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<h3>RAILWAY DEVELOPMENT IN THE REPUBLIC</h3>


<p>The place Argentina holds in the world is due to
the meat and wheat it sends to other lands. But
having recognised its fecundity as a good food-producing
area, it is well to start at the beginning.
Argentina may have had fine grazing tracks capable
of rearing untold millions of cattle and arable land
that had only to be scratched to yield excellent crops
of cereals; but without transport values are at a
minimum. Accordingly, the development and prosperity
of the Argentine is mainly due to railways.
The sum of £300,000,000 British capital is invested
in Argentine railways and electric tramways.</p>

<p>I travelled a good deal in the Republic, from
Buenos Aires to Inca in the Andes, and from Tucuman
in the north to Bahia Blanca in the south. I journeyed
over hundreds of miles of flat, featureless, dreary
country that grew nothing but wild grasses until a
few years ago. And there are plenty of sandy,
bush-studded, alkali-stricken acres&mdash;just as you find
barren patches in the United States, Canada, Siberia,
and Australia&mdash;but there are thousands of leagues
awakened into life, <i>estancias</i> with great herds of
cattle munching at the alfalfa, stretches of wheat
and maize, on and on, as though without end, the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
only break on the horizon being the colonist's mud
hut, a clump of trees&mdash;and it always seems the same
clump of trees&mdash;which indicates a ranch, and the
ever-whirring American water-wheel. As you travel
through England it is the spires of churches that
pierce the sky. The only thing that ever pierces the
sky on the Argentine pampas is the zinc American
water-wheel. The Argentine <i>estanciero</i> thinks a water-wheel
is of more use to him than a church.</p>

<p>All over this land, zigzagging, curving, intersecting,
sometimes running in an absolutely straight
line for a hundred and fifty miles, is the greatest
length of railway lines in the world for a population
of seven millions. The towns are far apart; villages
are few. You journey half a day, and, except at
the little wayside stations, do not see more than
half a dozen folk on the land. Yet it is a smiling
land, and greets the sunshine with abundance.
The railways in the Argentine are to garner this
wealth. Freight trains, with cars of the colossal
American pattern, trundle their long length across
the plains.</p>

<p>I recall one night when, at a forgotten siding,
the engine drew out to get water, taking a saunter
along the train side. It was brilliantly lit with
electricity, and the restaurant car, with the usual
little red-shaded lamps on the tables, was busy;
crowds of passengers were dining, and the usual
waiters were scurrying, and there was the usual
Continental fare, and champagne and Moselle wines,
and the usual mineral waters you get on the Nord
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
express. That gleaming train in central South
America was the symbol of what railway enterprise
has done in Argentina.</p>

<p>There are 20,000 miles of railroads in the Republic.
The British showed the way in the initial building,
and their lines pass through some of the fattest
territory. The French have been tardy followers,
but have constructed useful minor lines. The Argentine
Government has built State lines through country
that was suitable for colonisation, but which did
not appeal to the outside investor. These State
railways are financially a failure. One reason is that
the territory through which they run is not of the
best. The principal reason is that they are the
prey of the politicians. Constituencies have to be
considered, and innumerable jobs found for the
hangers-on of political parties. Business conditions
are the last to be thought of, and, though the Government
has done well in throwing these lines into
distant regions needing development, they are not
likely to succeed until placed under different
control.</p>

<p>Not only have the Argentines themselves not
started railway companies, but they have no money
invested in the foreign companies. One cause is
that, though the Government insists on a local
board of directors, the real board of directors is
abroad, chiefly in London. Another cause is that
dividends are limited by law to 7 per cent., and
that is not a sufficient return for the Argentine.
He does not care to touch investments that do not
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
yield 12 per cent., and when he gets 30 per cent.
he thinks that about fair&mdash;and the country is so
prosperous it can afford it.</p>

<p>Although within the last fifteen years millions of
British money have poured into Argentina for railway
construction, the investor in the old days cast
a hesitating eye on South America as a place to
sink his capital. In the 'fifties a railway a few miles
long was all that Argentina could boast, and ten years
later, when 7 per cent. was guaranteed, money was
not forthcoming. As an inducement to construct a
line between Rosario and Cordoba the absolute
ownership of three miles on either side of the line
was offered. Even with such an attraction the
British investor was shy.</p>

<p>Gradually, however, money was forthcoming, and
lines were laid. In the 'eighties there came a spurt.
It was not till the years following 1900 that money
could be had for the asking. Lines cobwebbed the
profitable country; distant points were linked up;
land which previously had little beyond prairie
value bounced up in price.</p>

<p>Though to-day there is a thought in the public
mind that a little too much money has been thrown
into Argentina, that land prices are too inflated&mdash;which
they are&mdash;I have traversed districts which three
years ago were wilderness; but a spur of railway
has been driven into them, and instantly farming has
been started. I saw hundreds of freshly-built homesteads&mdash;crude,
and the life harsh, but it was the
beginning of great things&mdash;and alfalfa had been
laid down, and cattle were feeding, and wide spaces
which previously were sandy and apparently inhospitable
were carpeted with the bright green of
new wheat. Just as in Canada there is a belief that
the breaking up of the land had decreased the severity
of the frost, so there is a belief in Argentina that
rains follow the plough. Places which formerly had
little rainfall, and which had a doubtful agricultural
future, are proving successful. Yet without the
advance of railways the country would have been as
forlorn as when the Indians roved the pampas.</p>

<p>Railway companies in England have had to fight
landowners to make headway. In Argentina landowners
welcome the coming of a railway, for obvious
reasons. Most of the wealthy Argentines owe their
fortunes to their land being benefited by the railways.
As a rule, out in the far districts, a railway
company can get the necessary land for nothing.
Owners are willing to make financial contributions.
The general managers of the big British railways in
Argentina get large salaries&mdash;£7,000 a year. This is
partly to remove them from the range of temptation
of being bribed by owners, syndicates, or land
companies to authorise the making of railways where
they would not be economically advisable. Of course,
extensions near the big towns cost the railways as
much as they would in England. I know a man who
thirty years ago bought a piece of land for £1,600.
He sold it to a railway company for over £200,000.</p>

<p>Though foreign capital is having so extensive a
run in networking the country with railways, the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Argentine Government has a much closer grip on
the working of the lines than the Board of Trade has
on English companies. It is therefore no misrepresentation
to say that, whilst private owners are glad
to have their property enhanced in value by the
juxtaposition of a railway, the Government puts
obstacles in the way for what are ostensibly public
reasons. Accordingly, expensive "diplomacy" has
sometimes to be used. The Government is sufficiently
aware of the return the foreign investor gets&mdash;and
when fresh extensions are sought it invariably
withholds its consent until some concession has been
wrung out of the company, such as an undertaking
to construct a line through a district that cannot,
for some time at any rate, be a success. There is
never any guarantee that another company will not
be formed to work the same district. The Government
smiles at the fight between the two lines for
traffic&mdash;to the public benefit. When companies
propose to amalgamate the Government either
makes such demands in regard to uneconomic lines
that the thing falls through or a veto is put upon
the amalgamation altogether.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is due to the excellence of the railways
that the Argentine high roads are so bad. And
frankly, though I know most of the new lands of the
world, I know of no region where the country roads
are so villainous as in this Republic. Rarely are they
anything beyond mother earth. In wet weather
they are quagmires, and I have seen vehicles stranded,
unable to be hauled by a team of five horses. In
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
summer, when rain is absent, they are foot-deep
furrows of dust. I shall never forget a motor excursion
through the sugar plantations round about
Tucuman. The way was like a magnified ploughed
field, and all the ridges were of dust. We drove
through it as an engine drives through snow.</p>

<p>All railway material comes in duty free, but one
of the conditions is that 3 per cent. of the profits
shall be used for the making of roads leading to railway
stations. The companies do not object, because
the call is not large, and it is to their interest that
agriculturists should be able to get their produce
to the railway station to be transported over the lines.</p>

<p>The Direccion-General de Ferrocarriles is the
authority over the railways in Argentina. It decides
the number of trains which shall be run, and it
insists on the number of coaches. There must be a
certain number of dormitory cars on all-night trains,
and restaurant cars are obligatory over certain
distances. Every train carries a letter-box, and
recently the companies have been squeezed into
carrying the mails for nothing. A medicine chest, a
stretcher, a bicycle&mdash;so that quick communication can
be made with the nearest station in case of accident&mdash;and
all sorts of necessities in case of a breakdown
are compulsory. Every carriage is thoroughly disinfected
every month, and there is always a card
to be initialled by an inspector. All bedding and
mattresses are subject to scientific disinfection such
as I have seen nowhere in Europe.</p>

<p>No time-tables can be altered without the sanction
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
of the National Railway Board at least two
months before coming into operation. If trains
stop at stations for which they are not scheduled a
heavy fine is imposed; and all late trains, and the
reason, have to be reported to the Government
authority. No alteration, however small, to a station
building or to the design of rolling stock is permissible
without the sanction of the Government representatives.
A complaint book is at every station,
open to anyone to complain on any subject. Guards
also keep a book. Many of the complaints are
amusing. I heard of one man who insisted on
writing in the complaint book that "everything was
in perfect order and the staff faultless." Occasionally
passengers will have a dispute, and whilst one
will find fault in the complaint book with the manners
of the train attendants, another will write beneath
that the attendants are all right, and it is the complainant's
manners which are at fault.</p>

<p>There are the usual buffers in front of an engine;
but they are all hinged, and have to be hoisted
backwards when a train is travelling, because if an
animal were run into, the cow-catcher might not be
able to throw the beast aside, for it could be caught
between the catcher and the protruding buffer.
Though, on the face of it, the Government subjects
the companies to innumerable restrictions, and
frequently imposes vexatious regulations, it must
be recognised that public safety is the thought
behind them all.</p>

<p>The Republic lives by its exports of meat and
agricultural produce. Ninety-five per cent. of this
trade is carried to the ports by the railways. From
the railroad cars one beholds productiveness; yet
fifteen or twenty miles away lies land just as productive
but as yet untouched by the plough, because
there is neither sufficient population to cultivate nor
railways to carry. Within the next dozen years
there must inevitably be a further spurt in the
making of feeding or auxiliary lines. Something like
£20,000,000 a year is crossing the ocean for fresh
railway enterprises in Argentina. Nearly 40,000,000
tons of goods are carried over the lines each year,
and the receipts are something like £25,000,000
annually. And yet but a fragment of the harvest
of this new land is being garnered. Its untrodden
millions of acres await new railways to open up
the country.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

<h3>SETTLEMENT ON THE LAND</h3>


<p>Prolific though Argentina is, and though its agricultural
wealth has only been scratched, it cannot
be described as an ideal country for the poor immigrant.
The eyes of the land have been well picked,
and there are rich personal estates covering one
hundred and fifty square miles.</p>

<p>There is little disposition to voluntary splitting up
of estates, but rather to hold whilst annually the value
increases with the coming of people and the advancement
of railways. The Government is doing something
to assist the small man with limited capital
to settle on distant Government lands. But the
poor immigrant, with nothing but his muscle and
his industry, has a long and rough road to travel
before he reaches independence as a landed proprietor.
It is a hard land in which to start making
a fortune; but the man of money who can step into
the Republic, say, with £25,000 to play with, and
who invests judiciously, can double his capital in
three years.</p>

<p>Whilst the old Argentines, those of Spanish
descent, have waxed wealthy simply by sitting still
and letting the foreigner develop their property,
there are British Argentine families whose estates,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
if realised, would produce double-figured millions,
and whose proprietors landed as labourers less than
fifty years ago. Money has come to lots of these
people, shrewd and lucky, as though they held the
key to a cave of jewels. Some have remained
modest in spite of possessions; others look upon
gold as the only god, and their blatant display at
Mar del Plata, and on the steamers of the Royal
Mail Company, is something which would make the
conduct of the new rich of Chicago Quakerish by
comparison.</p>

<p>The cry of Argentina, like that of all new lands,
is for population. Over 300,000 fresh arrivals land
annually from all corners of the earth, Russia, Syria,
France, Germany, and England, but mainly from
Spain and Italy. Whilst the Spaniard comes to stay,
there is a considerable ebb and flow amongst the
Italians, thousands coming out for the harvest when
wages are high, and making sufficient to return for
the rest of the year; then they return for the next
harvest. Allowing for the ebb, Argentina gets a
solid increase in population by immigration of over
250,000 persons a year, and there are no assisted
passages and no offers of free land.</p>

<p>At each of the ports are Government hotels for
immigrants. That at Buenos Aires accommodates
a thousand people. The new arrival, instead of
being distraught at landing in a strange country, or
possibly falling a prey to its sharks, is housed and
fed for five days as the guest of his new country.
Careful inquiry is made as to capabilities, and, as
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
there is a never-satisfied demand from the interior
for labourers, work is certain, and officials see him
and his baggage on the train, and an official meets
him at his destination and sees him firmly settled
in his fresh life. As work is assured, Argentina is
a land where there are no unemployed&mdash;except
amongst the dissolute, who are to be found in all
countries. I saw these immigrants on the <i>Avon</i>
gathered at Vigo, and I saw them in distant provinces,
and I was struck with their sturdiness and
health. I place on record that I never saw a drunken
man during all my wanderings in the Republic.
Blessed with a fine climate, and the winter so temperate
that fires are not necessary, life is easy, and
there is no crushing into towns for work, as is usual
in Canada during the frozen months.</p>

<p>Owing to such immense tracts being held by individual
owners&mdash;many of whom prefer the pleasures
of Paris and Buenos Aires to living on the land where
the cereals are grown&mdash;most of the cultivation is
done by "colonists." The system varies in different
parts of the country, but the general procedure is
much on these lines. In a little centre of population,
maybe a village, but important because those who
live many miles round are dependent upon it for
supplies, is to be found a store where most things
can be bought, from a plough to a tin kettle. The
storekeeper enters into a contract with the owner
of vast lands to cultivate it, either on rent or on
shares of the value of the produce. This storekeeper
is a middleman, often a sweater. Though I
have no doubt there are honourable exceptions, he
is often a thief into the bargain. He gets a "colonist"
to take over a certain area and to cultivate it
on shares. The "colonist" has to build a mud
house, and sink a well, and he has to buy his plough
and hire his horses, and obtain all necessaries from
the middleman, who can fix his own price. When
the wheat or the maize is gathered the only man
to whom the "colonist" can sell is the middleman,
who has it very much in his own hands to say what
the price shall be, and he frequently furnishes the
ignorant "colonist" with false returns as to quantity.
But even then he keeps back what is owing
on agricultural implements and loaned horses, with
the consequence that the poor fellow has very little&mdash;if
any&mdash;margin. It is not too much to say that
the "colonists" are in the grip of the middlemen,
and it is with difficulty they are ever able to break
free.</p>

<p>Of course, the middleman runs risk of little return
if there is drought and a bad harvest, and, on the
other hand, when he proceeds to sell the wheat he
finds himself encompassed by a ring of four Jewish
firms, who control the wheat market of the Argentine.
The whole practice is vicious, and I cannot but think
that before long the Government will have to take
the matter in hand.</p>

<p>Admitting the exquisite climate, and the fertility
of the soil, and Nature's quick response to light
work, the lives of these "colonists" in the distant
camp is sad. Men of the Basque country, the north
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
of Spain, the north of Italy, they come from the
homeland, where means of livelihood were sparse, to
this new land, where, although the chances are rather
against them to secure independence, their material
well-being is certainly better than in the Old Country.
But they are ignorant people; they know nothing of,
and so care nothing for, the refinements of life; their
houses are not much better than kraals. They are
removed by long distances from neighbours; they
live on a featureless plain, and have no communication
with the outer world; they cannot read, and
books and newspapers are foreign to them. Their
world is fringed by the horizon. A visit to the wayside
station, where, maybe, one train a day passes,
is their excitement. There are no schools and no
religious instruction. Their moral standard is low.</p>

<p>Many of these "colonists" take to farming with
a minimum of practical knowledge. Yet, though I
have just drawn a rueful picture, I would not have
it thought there are no illuminating spots. A
valuable work is being carried on in agricultural
instruction. On several occasions I came across
specially-built railway cars in which lecturers travel
all over the Republic and freely give advice to the
peons how to get most out of the soil. During
the last seven years (since 1907) the Government
has zealously appreciated the need for organising
the agricultural and live-stock instruction.
The work is not to be compared with the
splendid agricultural colleges to be found all over
the United States. The significant thing, however,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
is that the people of the Argentine&mdash;perfectly
conscious of all the advantages of science, and with
most of its best sons educated in Europe&mdash;have
taken hold of this problem of how to train its population
to get the best out of the soil. So schools
are being formed over the country where information
can be obtained about the special productivity of
particular districts, about the growing of grasses,
the feeding and care of beasts, milk production,
sugar-growing, cheese-making, market-gardening,
fruit-rearing, and in far western Mendoza I came
across a college that is making instructive experiments
in viticulture.</p>

<p>Besides agricultural courses at the Universities,
there is much done by way of University extension
lectures; but instead of lectures about sea-power
in the sixteenth century, or the relationship of
Henry VIII. to Rome, the lectures are on the breeding
of cattle, the raising of maize, the sowing of
alfalfa.</p>

<p>It was my fortune to meet many cultured and
travelled Argentines, but, summing the people in
a lump, and excluding the viciousness which trails
behind the wealth of Buenos Aires, and also making
allowance for the lack of that virility and perseverance
of those strong men who are fighting the big battle
in Canada, the thing which constantly confronted
me was the fact that here in South America was a
nation, born yesterday, thoroughly alive to the
worth of its possessions, brusquely modern, content
with nothing but the latest appliances and machinery
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
and thoroughly determined that, in the contest
amongst the widespread agricultural lands to supply
food to the millions in crowded Europe, Argentina
will not be satisfied with an inferior position.</p>

<p>In a subsequent chapter I will deal with what
has already been accomplished in this field. Here,
however, I limit myself to pointing out that Argentina
is increasing her capabilities with a purely
practical education. Men who can neither read nor
write, but have come under the influence of these
itinerant schools, can talk with scientific knowledge
about their trade of food producing, be it meat
or cereals.</p>

<p>Now another step is being made, and I trust with
happy results in view of the unfortunate position of
the "colonists." So successful has been the agricultural
instruction during the past half dozen years,
that the next thing is to develop the commercial
spirit so that the farmer may have some chance
of getting a fair return for his labour. Free lectures
are given on the business side of agriculture. Then,
attached to the schools are special buildings for
experiments; and boarded pupils, the sons of men
who understand the money value of knowledge, are
given a thorough training. So that all may benefit
there are free scholarships, and I found that preference
is given to competitors who come from districts,
suitable for a special industry, where schools have
not yet been established.</p>

<p>Anyone who visits the school for viticulture in
Mendoza, for agriculture and live stock in Cordoba,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
and for arboriculture and sugar-making in Tucuman&mdash;and
I saw all three&mdash;comes away nothing less
than amazed at the way these transplanted Latins,
away south of the Equator and across six thousand
miles of ocean, are making headway&mdash;and the start
only begun a few years ago. There is the real spirit
of enthusiasm combined with an optimism which
to a man from a staid old country seems exaggerated
until, seeing what has been done, imagination
is allowed to jump freely into the future. At Mendoza,
nestling at the foot of the Andes and reminiscent
of a town in Tuscany, where the whole countryside
is covered with vineyards and wine is being made
to supply millions of wine drinkers in the country&mdash;for
the Argentine peasant takes wine with his
breakfast&mdash;experiments are made with the best
known vines from Europe on a farm of sixty-seven
acres, so that grapes suitable to the soil may be
matured. At Cordoba the school has 445 acres, and
investigation is made to secure earlier and higher
yields, and with special attention to obtaining
varieties which have powers of resisting drought.
The same sort of thing goes on at Tucuman. The
sugar industry is increasing at astonishing speed.
Many men with scant practical knowledge are
attracted to it. The school gives them instruction
and will send members of the technical staff to the
sugar factories and distilleries to give assistance.
Facts like these argue that Argentina is a country
really to be reckoned with, and is not to be dismissed&mdash;as
I have heard it dismissed in England,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
even amongst those who consider themselves educated&mdash;as
a rubbishy South American Republic,
whose only crop is revolutions.</p>

<p>All over the Republic "regional schools" are
being set up to provide instruction, not in general
agricultural subjects, but in regard to the special
requirements of the locality&mdash;for Argentina varies
in climate from tropical in the north to stern cold
in the south; dairying, with a model dairy, at Belle
Ville; fruit culture at San Juan; forestry in the
Benitz colony. A scheme has been devised to equip
Argentina with agricultural knowledge by means of
courses for children and adults, travelling lecturers,
information bureaus, co-operative experiments,
regional shows, encouragement of agricultural
societies, organisation of regional agricultural experts
and military farms. Further, the National
Government have done an enormous service in
providing irrigation works in regions where the
rainfall is uncertain.</p>

<p>It has to be admitted that some areas are subject
to drought, and this and other evils have to be
taken into consideration when reviewing the agricultural
growth of a country like Argentina, which
lives by its produce, and which in 1912 exported
£36,000,000 worth of live-stock products and
£53,000,000 worth of agricultural products. Given
good years, the <i>estanciero</i> in average country makes
30 per cent. on the year. He can afford to have one
bad year in three and yet be prosperous. But
although districts suffer, the area of the country is
so vast that losses are swamped in general prosperity.</p>

<p>As the older countries of the world concern themselves
with national defence, Argentina has established
a Department of Agricultural Defence, chiefly to
fight the plague of locusts, which can eat out a whole
district in a single night. I recall in Cordoba Province
seeing in the distance what looked like a cloud
of smoke. It was a storm of locusts, so dense as it
passed that midday was reduced to twilight. The
locust blights the land&mdash;it is the enemy. The locust
is the thing which makes the farmer shudder. When
it comes it not only devours every blade of grass
within miles, but it lays its eggs in untold millions.
The pest has to be destroyed. The Government
readily assists localities to destroy the ova. The
route of the swarms from the tropical north is known.
The telegraph tells of the progress. When they land,
the countryside turns out and catches them by
the cartload. Sometimes the district in which they
have settled is fired. The whole zone where eggs
have been planted is ploughed. Animals are driven
forth to trample the pest. The Government has in
its possession over 20,000,000 yards of metallic
barriers to make a line of defence, and when a swarm
is penned it is suffocated, burnt, or trampled. The
Government not only has its inspectors out, is ever
ready to meet and repel the locust invasion from
Brazil and Bolivia with suitable appliances, but gives
financial assistance to those who help in the extermination.
The Argentines are determined to stop
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
this pest. The way they are setting about the work
is evidence of their earnestness.</p>

<p>The point I specially desire to make, however,
is that farming in Argentina is not all casual, but
is becoming a developed national industry. There
are many things to criticise about the Government;
there is maladministration and there is peculation.
But that so much has been accomplished, notwithstanding
these drawbacks, accentuates the wonders
of progress.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

<h3>ARGENTINA'S PART IN FEEDING THE WORLD</h3>


<p>It is well to mark that of the British food supply
from overseas Argentina provides one quarter. Each
person in the Republic, after providing enough food
to supply himself, sends at least £8 worth of food
to other countries.</p>

<p>Argentina covers 776 million acres. Eighty
million acres are suitable for wheat, but only one-fourth
of this area is cultivated. The population is
growing rapidly; it is now over seven millions, and
is being increased by about a quarter of a million
immigrants every year; but still the cry is for more
inhabitants.</p>

<p>At present there are six persons to the square
mile; but when you remember that the province of
Buenos Aires has a population of two and a half
millions, you find the population for the outside
areas is just under two per square mile.</p>

<p>Three-quarters of the population are Argentines;
everyone born in the country, no matter from what
land the parents come, is reckoned an Argentine.
Of the new-comers half a million are Italian, a
quarter million Spanish, a tenth of a million French;
then come the British, numbering 25,000; Germans
18,000; Swiss 15,000; Austrians 13,000, and so
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
on, decreasingly. North Americans are few, though
within recent years much United States capital has
quietly taken hold of certain industries. Argentina
is capable of carrying a population of fifty millions,
and it will secure them within the next half-century.
In race, language, customs, religion, it is especially
favourable to folk from the thronged Latin countries
of Europe.</p>

<p>Every settler becomes a violent Argentine. The
emphatic patriotism of the American is tepid alongside
the hot-blooded nationality of Argentina. It is
daily inculcated in the schools. The blue and white
striped flag is honoured on every occasion. You
are poetically reminded it is of the blue of the sky.
When the Argentines were in revolution against
Spain in 1810, and needed a banner to flaunt against
the red and orange of the enemy, they got pieces
of blue and white cloth (intended for garments) from
an English warship lying at Montevideo, and made
a flag of it. So the Argentine flag, like much of
Argentine prosperity, is due to Britain.</p>

<p>In proportion to the population there are as
many millionaires in Argentina as in the United
States. There are sturdy old fellows, who can
hardly write their names, who scarcely know the
extent of their wealth. Fifty years ago an Irish
labourer landed in the country. He died the other
day worth over £4,000,000.</p>

<p>It is none of my business to boom land values
in Argentina. Though the tendency of late has been
a little too buoyant, I know of no land where there
have been such enormous heaves in values, not
fictitiously hoisted, but legitimate on development
of commerce, as in this Republic. In 1885 you
could buy land in the centre of Buenos Aires at
2s. 6d. a square yard. Now you must pay £200 a
yard. A suburban plot of 60 by 20 yards, which
you could have got twelve years ago for £5, will
cost £150. Fine camp land&mdash;the "camp" is the
Argentine name for farming districts&mdash;which could
be got for a song a quarter of a century ago will
now fetch £100,000 the square league (three miles).
I know a plot of land at Rosario which has jumped
in value from £2,000 to £40,000 in twenty years.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand how Argentine millionaires
are made. In the wars with neighbouring
Republics Argentine officers were given tracts of
country in lieu of pay: of small value then, but
their descendants are fabulously wealthy. The careful
Briton who came out when railways were beginning
to speed through the country, and acted shrewdly,
got land for next to nothing which will bring a better
price per acre than land in the home counties. I
am writing this in mid-Atlantic on my way home,
and each morning on deck I exchange a bow with
an old lady who owns 180 square miles of the finest
agricultural land in the province of Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>In a previous chapter my pen was somewhat
free about the ostentation of the Argentine. But
the display of wealth is frequently put to a good
purpose. When a fabulous price is paid for a Derby
winner it is an Argentine who has found the money.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Argentina has a fine breed of horses. As the cattle
industry is so important, the best stock is purchased
at home. I went to the agricultural show in September,
1913. All the judges had been brought out
from England, partly because good judging was
needed, but chiefly, I fear, because the Argentines
cannot trust each other to give unbiassed decisions.
The show was finer housed than any royal show in
England, and the quality of the exhibits was quite
on a level with anything we can produce. The prize
bull, Argentine bred, was sold by auction for over
£7,000. Admitted this was a fancy price due to
the rivalry of breeders to have the best and to boast
about it. A thousand pounds has been paid by a
meat company for a Hereford bull to kill; but this
may be ascribed to advertisement.</p>

<p>The <i>estancias</i>&mdash;ranches or stations&mdash;are frequently
enormous in extent, as wide as an English county,
and are managed as well as any great estates in
Australia, Canada, or New Zealand. There are the
usual show places, maintained by Anglo-Argentines,
where the immediate grounds are laid out like an
English park, the farm buildings all on the model
plan, and the animals of the best stock, whilst a
successful endeavour is made toward converting the
house into something palatial. Though some <i>estancias</i>
are far inland, and distant from a railway line,
life is far more enjoyable than might be thought.
The rich <i>estanciero</i>, however, spends little of his
time on his land. He is too often an absentee landlord.
He has tasted the joys of Europe; besides,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
his wife and daughters are inclined to prefer Buenos
Aires to life in the camp, however healthy. The
place is usually run by a manager. Then there are
sub-managers, often young Englishmen who have
heard of the fortunes to be made; next there are the
peons, Spaniards and Italians, who do the meaner
work. Life in the camp is arduous. Men are out
at dawn, rounding up cattle, giving an eye to the
"colonists," attending to fencing, driving beasts
to the railway station to be transferred to the
"freezers," and it is sundown when the work is
over and men go to their quarters. It is a strenuous
life, and the employees have little of the
pleasures of civilisation.</p>

<p>Within the last ten years the export value of
live stock products has increased from £23,000,000
to £36,000,000, and agricultural products from
£21,000,000 to £53,000,000. Since 1896 the area
under cultivation has grown from 13 million acres
to nearly 50 million acres. Of Argentine cereals
the United Kingdom imported 1,654,000 tons. There
are 30 million cattle in the Republic and 80 million
sheep. The breeding of sheep is not what it was,
because the Argentine finds he can get a better
return from cattle and cereals. So, whilst the value
of exported mutton remains very much what it was
ten years ago (about £1,250,000), the value of the
exported chilled and frozen beef has risen from
£1,500,000 to over £6,000,000 a year.</p>

<p>At the ports are big slaughtering establishments,
some belonging to Argentine companies, and others
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
to American companies. A bitter feud is being
waged to capture the chilled and frozen meat trade,
especially in the English market. As England is
only three weeks' distance, meat that is only chilled
has an enormous advantage over meat from more
distant countries which must be frozen. The fact
is denied, but it may be taken as certain that there
is a big combination of Chicago houses endeavouring
to squeeze their competitors out of business&mdash;and
they seem in a fair way to succeed. The Argentine
public are showing fright, and there have been
frantic appeals to Congress that steps be taken to
check the creation of a trust. Also it is hoped that
England may take action. But the authorities in
both countries decline to do anything. The Chicago
firms have a long purse and are damaging their rivals
at both ends, first by paying Argentine cattle breeders
unprecedented prices for beasts, and then by selling
the meat below cost price in the Smithfield market.
Of course, in reply to what is happening, one hears
the statement, "Why grumble, when the Argentine
cattle dealer gets a high price for his beasts, the
London consumer gets cheap meat, and the Chicago
firms pay the difference?" That is true. But it
does not need much business foresight to understand
that when the Anglo-Argentine companies
are bankrupt the Chicago trust, having the game in
their own hands, will pay their own price for cattle
and lift the price of meat in London. Meanwhile,
the Argentine <i>estanciero</i> is quite happy, and is willing
to let the future take care of itself. One thing,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
however, may safely be prophesied. The Argentine
Government has a drastic way of doing things. If
the expected happens, and the Chicago houses secure
the meat industry and begin to force down prices
for cattle, there will not be the slightest hesitation
in passing a law which will make things uncomfortable
for the trust.</p>

<p>With the care taken in breeding, always striving
after improving the strain of the stock, Argentina,
with its millions of acres of pasturage, is determined
not to slacken the stride of its improving meat
trade. The best lands are given to wheat, maize,
oats; but the use of alfalfa has meant an amazing
expansion of productivity, for this nutritious plant,
a kind of sanfoil, will grow abundantly on land that
is little good for other purposes. Areas at which
the agriculturist was inclined to shrug his shoulders
as barren prosper under alfalfa, the best of feeding
stuffs, and several crops can be got in a year. Two
acres will carry a beast. Alfalfa grown for fodder
gives a hundred per cent. profit. Alfalfa, whilst
drawing nitrogen from the ground, attracts nitrogen
from the air. One ton of alfalfa contains 50 lb.
of nitrogen. Three tons of alfalfa has as much
nitrogen as two tons of wheat. It is easy to grow,
and cattle fatten on it abundantly. The alfalfa of
Argentina means more to the prosperity of the
country than rich gold mines. As there is no winter,
as we understand it, the cattle are left out all the
year, and there is no stalling or hand feeding.</p>

<p>Cattle disease is more prevalent than with us.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
This is partly due to carelessness, but chiefly to the
herds being so large that the scourge becomes
virulent before it is noticed. Then, as I have indicated,
there is the danger of drought and the
dread of locusts. Further, so much of the cereal
growing being in the hands of "colonists," too
often anything but expert farmers, the yield is by
no means what it would be if the farming were in
more skilled hands. So, whilst the average yield
of wheat in Great Britain is thirty-one bushels to
the acre; in Argentina it is only eleven bushels.
But manuring is unknown in the Republic.</p>

<p>Yet, keeping one's eyes open to all the disadvantages,
one cannot go through the country and
see its fecundity, go into the killing houses at La
Plata and Buenos Aires, watch the ocean liners,
with the Union Jack dangling over their stern, being
loaded with many sides of beef, visit the grain elevators
at the ports of Bahia Blanca and Rosario pouring
streams of wheat destined for European consumption
into the holds of liners, without the imagination
being stimulated when standing on the threshold
of this new land's possibilities.</p>

<p>Already Argentina holds first place in the quantity
of exported frozen meat. It was in 1877 that
the Republic led the way in exporting such meat
to Europe. It was not till 1885, however, that the
business of freezing was definitely established. To-day
£11,000,000 is invested in "freezing works."
And millions of cattle and sheep are slaughtered for
foreign consumption. There seems to be something
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 97]</a></span>
of a race at present between live stock products
and agricultural products which shall hold first
place in value of exports. The ports of Argentina,
with a capacity for 45 million tons, are ever busy.
Yet they are only in infancy.</p>

<p>Like all new lands, where enterprise and optimism
frequently leap beyond rigid economies, Argentina
has its heaves and falls. We know of the hundreds
of millions of foreign capital invested. People do
not go to Argentina for the beauty of the scenery.
They go for money-making. Often when I came
across some evidence of Latin sluggishness, saw what
had not been done, what might have been done,
and then remembered what, nevertheless, had been
done, I found myself exclaiming: "Oh, that this
land were a British colony!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<h3>THE CONSTITUTION AND GOVERNMENT</h3>


<p>New countries, in planning their system of government,
have advantages over old lands steeped in
tradition and hampered by precedent. They can
profit by the mistakes of the older countries, and
can, more or less, start with a clean slate. As men
past middle age are disposed to think the young
fellows of the present day headstrong, lacking in
ballast, it is all in the nature of things that the older
countries should look with a somewhat critical eye
upon the experiments in government made by
youngsters amongst the nations. So it is instructive
to look at the system of law and administration
in the Republic.</p>

<p>The head of authority, in which the executive
power of the nation is vested, is the President. He
must be an Argentine, a Roman Catholic, and being
elected for six years can never be elected again.
This is a provision to prevent a Dictatorship. The
President for the time being is head of the Army
and Navy; he nominates the judges, selects bishops,
appoints diplomatic representatives to other nations,
and all the secretaries of State are chosen by him.
There are two Houses, the Senate and the Chamber
of Deputies; but a Minister can be neither a senator
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
nor a deputy. He can attend debates, speak and
defend himself from criticism, but he is beyond
the power of either House. If he likes, he need
appear only once a year in Congress to make an
annual report about the working of his Department.
So he is removed from the constant cross-examination
which is the fate of Ministers in the British
Houses of Parliament.</p>

<p>The Senate consists of thirty members, two from
the capital and two from each province. Those
sent from Buenos Aires are elected by certain high
franchised electors, and those from outside are
nominated by the provincial legislatures. A senator
must be thirty years of age, must have been a citizen
of the Republic for at least six years, and have a
personal income of £160 a year. A senator is elected
for nine years, and can offer himself for re-election.
But every three years ten senators of the thirty,
decided by ballot, must retire, though they can be
re-chosen. No "carpet-bagging" is allowed. A
senator must either be a native of his province or
have lived in it for at least two years before his
election. The provinces vary considerably in population,
but they have equal voice in the Senate.
Thus it is a body which may be said to represent
localities rather than individuals.</p>

<p>The Chamber of Deputies, however, is chosen
direct by the people. There is one deputy for every
thirty-three thousand inhabitants. No man can
become a candidate unless he is twenty-five years
of age, has been a citizen at least four years, born
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
in the province, or lived in it for two years. Thus
there is never anything in the nature of a general
election, but there is a constant movement going on
to secure the proper representation of the people.</p>

<p>Both senators and deputies receive a salary of
£1,500 a year, so they are the best-paid legislators
in the world. Both Chambers meet on May 1st and
adjourn on September 30th. Only the Chamber of
Deputies can have a voice in taxation. As I have
shown in the preceding chapter, the Argentine
Government&mdash;which, like all Governments, is open
to criticism&mdash;has done a great deal in advancing
legislation for the solid benefit of the country. There
cannot be said to be government on party principles,
but the Government is maintained by the
followers of particular men. Politicians in Argentina,
as elsewhere, have their enemies, and when a man
has been elected to Congress he sometimes dare
not attend, for that would mean leaving the constituency,
and there would always be some rival
busy sapping his influence. I was in Buenos Aires
toward the close of the session. Day after day the
House met, but nothing could be done, for no quorum
could be obtained. Public business was at a standstill.
It was proposed the President should employ
the police to search Buenos Aires, arrest legislators,
haul them along, and thus "make a House" with
locked doors, so that business could be proceeded
with. Everybody was crying out against the scandal
of Congressmen drawing such large salaries and doing
nothing to earn them. But nothing was done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides the excellent remuneration for not attending
to business, the Argentine politician has the
advantage of getting jobs for all his relatives. The
majority of Government employees are the relatives
of politicians. There are true and honourable men
in political life, but, so far as I could gather, most
men take to politics in Argentina because they can
do their families a good turn. The only group that
is cohesive is that of the Socialists. Socialist deputies
are on the increase. Nearly all the freshly arrived
immigrants, Spanish and Italian, when they get their
naturalisation papers after a residence of two years,
vote Socialist.</p>

<p>Now, whilst everything which affects the Republic
as a whole is decided upon by the central Government,
each province has its local government, with
governor, two Houses, and considerable power, quite
independent of the central executive. This is following
the United States plan. The principle of devolution
is a good one, that districts should administer
their own affairs without interference by those who
cannot know local circumstances. But Argentina
has frequently the same trouble that the United
States has, and similarly would like to get rid of.
There are differences in the provincial laws, so that
what is allowed in one province is prohibited in
another, with the consequence that, though the
process of trade is not hampered, it is often irritated.</p>

<p>Then the provincial Governments, sovereign in
their own realm, sometimes enact laws which the
federal Government declares affect general conditions
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
in the Republic. They infringe the prerogative
of the central executive. Accordingly, the relationship
between the central Government and the local
Governments is frequently strained. It is the smaller
provinces which cause the most trouble. Some of
them have a population that, all told, would not
stock a fair-sized town. That, however, does not
diminish their sense of importance. They are cock-a-hoop.
They know what is for their good; they
will pass what laws they like; they are not going
to be dictated to by those overpaid fellows who go
to Buenos Aires. The federal Government cannot
use force, and the provincial Governments snap
their fingers. For instance, Mendoza insists on
printing her own paper money. It is quite clear,
if serious trouble is to be avoided, that the federal
and provincial Governments must meet in conference
and draw up hard-and-fast rules dealing with
their respective powers and limitations.</p>

<p>So far as the individual is concerned, the theory
is liberty and equality. The stranger has the same
rights before the law as the citizen. The State, however,
interferes in the matter of property. A man
is not allowed, as in England, to leave his possessions
to whom he likes. A father must leave his wife
and children four-fifths of his property; a husband,
if there are no children, must let half his belongings
go to his wife; an unmarried son is obliged to leave
his parents two-thirds of his property. Only the
man without parents, wife, or children can dispose
of his property by testament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no obligation upon a foreigner resident
in the country to become a citizen before he can
start a trade or own estate. Two years' residence is
the qualifying period to become a citizen of the
Republic. If you enter the public service you can
become a citizen earlier. If you marry an Argentine
woman you can become a citizen right away. Every
child born in Argentina, even though its parents be
British and on a fortnight's visit, and have no
desire to change their nationality, is counted an
Argentine. Thus there are lots of residents with a
dual nationality, Argentine in the Republic, but
British in any other part of the world.</p>

<p>Though the Roman Catholic faith is that of
the State, and other faiths are not restricted, the
average Argentine pays little attention to religion.
He likes his wife to go to church because it does her
good. Education comprises three divisions: primary,
secondary, and higher. The former is free,
secular, and compulsory for children between six
and fourteen years. If religious instruction is to
be given it is only for those children who voluntarily
remain after school hours on certain days.
Public schools are scattered all over the Republic&mdash;though
there are extensive districts where the
population is thin where there is no instruction, and
thousands of children grow up illiterate&mdash;and are
subsidised by both the national and provincial
Governments. Also there are primary schools for
grown-ups, men whose education has been neglected,
and who want to learn reading, writing, arithmetic,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
and elementary history and geography. This teaching
is given during the day or evening, and is free.</p>

<p>Secondary education for pupils over fourteen
years is neither compulsory nor free, though the
fees only amount to 8s. 9d. a year. This secondary
instruction, quite as wide in range as elsewhere, is
given in national schools, of which there are five
in Buenos Aires and one in each of the capitals of
the provinces, and normal schools, which are twenty-eight
in number, three in Buenos Aires and the
remainder in the provinces. Five years is about the
length of tuition at these schools. Then the students
can enter one or other of the faculties which form
the university. There are three universities in
Argentina; the oldest is in Cordoba, and the others
are in Buenos Aires and La Plata. To qualify in
either of these universities for the practice of medicine,
law, or engineering, a seven-years' course is required
for the former and a six-years' course for the two
latter. Minor terms of special study are required
for qualification as a chemist, accoucheur, dental
surgeon, surveyor, or architect. In order to obtain
the degree of doctor in physical sciences further
studies are required outside those of the faculties.
The university council cannot grant a qualification
for a notary public, which must be acquired before
the Supreme Court of the particular province in
which the applicant seeks permission to practise.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>

<p>Primary education in the capital and national
territories is under the National Ministry of Education.
In the provinces it is under the control of
the Provincial Council of Education, who receive
subventions from the national exchequer as occasion
may require. The intuitive method is employed
exclusively, and the whole system is modelled on
that of the United States. As a rule, Spanish children
learn Italian from their classmates, and vice versa.
In the elementary higher standards, boys learn
manual labour and French, and girls learn French
and domestic duties. The schools are well built,
well ventilated, the rooms are airy, each child has
a separate desk, there is a medical visit every day,
and where schools are within reach they are fairly
well attended. But only 42 per cent. of the children
in the Republic who ought to go to school do so.
The low attendance may be put down to the great
distances which separate the children's homes from
the schools in the country districts. Very general
complaints are heard in the villages of the manner
in which the schools are conducted, and the small
amount of knowledge acquired in spite of the flattering
picture presented by the education authorities.</p>

<p>Considerable attention is paid to technical education,
which is largely encouraged throughout the
country by means of schools and training colleges
maintained at the expense of the nation. Prominent
among these institutions stands the National School
of Commerce, which trains and prepares mercantile
experts, public accountants, and sworn translators.
There are also commercial schools in Cordoba and
Bahia Blanca. These schools are attended by about
a thousand pupils, who receive instruction in commercial
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
arithmetic, account and book-keeping, French,
German, etc. The schools are open to both sexes,
and in them the pupils can qualify for employment
as book-keepers, accountants, clerks, etc. The Industrial
School has its own workshops for the teaching
of trades. The entrance conditions are similar
to those for the national schools. Thorough practical
instruction is given to about four hundred pupils
in a number of subjects, including chemistry,
mechanics, physics, optics, electricity, architecture,
practical carpentry, mechanical and electrical engineering.
The complete course lasts about six years,
and the school is said to have given very good results.
There is a School of Mines at San Juan, to which
was added, by a decree dated April 20th, 1906, a
section of chemical industry. There is an important
agricultural college known as the Agrarian and
Veterinary School at Santa Catalina in the immediate
neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, and at Mendoza
there is a viticultural training school where
the practical cultivation of the vine is taught.
Various other agricultural and horticultural schools
are being established by the Government, which
also supports the National School of Pilots, several
conservatories of music, and a drawing school.</p>

<p>There is a naval and military college, from which
officers are chosen for the navy and army, but they
do not come under the Ministry of Education. By
order of the Ministry of War physical drill and rifle
shooting are taught in the two highest classes of all
secondary schools, these exercises being subject to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
the supervision of a military officer. The Argentine
Government has founded numerous scholarships, and
sends students to England, the United States, Italy,
France, and Germany. It will be seen that the
plan of education is very complete; but it would
not appear to give such good results as might be
anticipated, for it is a very general complaint that
there are no good schools in the country districts.</p>

<p>The attention of the public is frequently called
in the newspapers to the unsatisfactory condition of
education, in spite of the large sums of money spent
upon it annually. It is shown how small is the
attendance at the primary schools compared with
what it should be if the law was properly obeyed,
as would be the case were the results more satisfactory.
It is also asserted that the education in
the secondary schools is especially defective, and
that certificates are issued to university candidates
without previous examination, and after merely
nominal questioning by inspectors. There are numerous
foreign private schools in the country, which
all have to submit by law to Government supervision.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>There is compulsory military service. The period
of continuous training does not exceed one year,
and this only in the case of a proportion of the
annual contingent. The others are released after
three months' drill. With varying periods of training
every Argentine from the age of twenty to forty-five
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
is liable to be called upon to defend his country.
Though years may pass without any call to attend
military drill, every man in the country must learn
to shoot.</p>

<p>Heavy duties are imposed on most manufactured
articles imported, except in the case of material
directly beneficial to the development of the country,
such as machinery. Anything which helps in the
progress of the Republic has easy entry. So, though
it means two years' residence to become a naturalised
citizen, anyone who establishes a new industry, or
introduces a useful invention, who has contracted
to build railways or establish a colony, or who is
going to be a teacher in any branch of education
or industry, is admitted at once. All these regulations
go to show that, despite the perfectly legitimate
criticisms which can be made, there is sound common-sense
and foresight in the minds of the governing
classes.</p>

<p>Everyone in any business or profession must pay
an annual licence, and these vary from five to sixty
thousand dollars. The latter sum is paid by banks.
Money-lenders have to pay from five to seven thousand
dollars, whilst in some provinces the <i>patente</i>
varies from three to six hundred dollars a year. The
postal and telegraph services are under the control
of the Ministry of the Interior. Most of the taxation
is indirect. Though the tariffs imposed on manufactured
articles coming into the country are high&mdash;except
in the case of specified articles, which are
counted as beneficial for the development of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
country&mdash;and consequently one is disposed to gasp
at the price of things compared with Europe, it is
not to be forgotten that the direct taxation is not
so high as in Europe. I heard it asserted that the
reason there are high tariffs is to stimulate manufacture
in Argentina. If so, the result has not been
markedly apparent. The effect might have been
so if the mass of the immigrants into Argentina came
from manufacturing countries, like Germany, Belgium,
France, Great Britain, or the United States.
That is not so, and one of the hindering checks has
been the language. The crowd has come from Italy
and Spain, mostly unskilled labourers or men whose
knowledge is limited to the land.</p>

<p>Argentina has no coal&mdash;and that will always
handicap her if she enters the field as a manufacturing
nation. The climate being what it is, there is
no need of coal for heating purposes. A fire-place
is a rare sight. But the importation of coal is
a heavy charge on the working of railways and on
shipping. Syndicates are now endeavouring to introduce
oil as fuel. Oil has been found in the country,
but as yet not in sufficient quantity to make it an
important addition to the products of the Republic.
So I see small prospect of Argentina's ever becoming
a manufacturing country in the modern meaning of
the phrase. Blest as she is in innumerable respects,
she could not be worse placed if she had any such
desire. She cannot produce cheaper, because most
of her raw material, including coal, must be imported,
and heavy freights would handicap economic production.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Take the case of two raw materials which
she has in abundance, leather and wool. There are
shoe factories, but the quality can in no way compete
with that of the importations. Only the rougher
kind of boots are made. There is some woollen
manufacturing, but the material produced is crude,
except in a few cases. Besides, the rush of immigrants
is to the land, and not into workshops.
The men who are skilled artizans are few. Therefore,
although here and there you get local manufacturers
who can hold their own in the markets, it
may be said that in general the articles imported
are better and cheaper, notwithstanding the tariff.
However, as I will show in a later chapter, there
is room for industrial development within a defined
range.</p>

<p>Then there are the constant labour disputes in
the towns. Running along with the prosperity of
the country is the trouble of repeated strikes amongst
the workers. It is not my province to go into the
merits of the respective disputes. But they have
been so recurrent, and have so much hampered
trade, that the Government has taken the most
drastic measures by laying hands on the chiefs of
trade unions when grievances are fomented and
strikes threatened.</p>

<p>Although the number of the strings of commerce
which are in the hands of Englishmen is gratifying,
it would have been strange if I had not heard the
usual complaint that the Germans are edging in,
and that, if care is not taken, the British will be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
ousted from their pre-eminence. It was the old
story that British merchants are too conservative,
and do not pay sufficient heed to the personal likings
of Argentine customers. It is true I saw lots of
German goods. They were cheaper and not of the
same quality as those of British make. Further,
German houses give much longer credit than do their
British rivals. Another cause of complaint is that
in business disputes the long-drawn-out law's delay,
and the obstacles in the path of the foreigner seeking
redress, mean that justice is not always secured.</p>

<p>It is not to be denied that, although the returns
are excellent, Britain does not retain the same proportion
of the import trade which she had a few years
ago. There is no disputing the superiority of the
British article; but German and French merchants
having a market to secure are more accommodating
to their customers, whilst in regard to agricultural
implements the United States makers are pushing
their hardest. Their machines are more showy than
the English. It seems a small point, and yet I have
thought it would be well if our British manufacturers
would not only turn out a serviceable tool, but bear
in mind the temperament of the people who are to
be the buyers. Put two threshing machines in a
Buenos Aires warehouse, that from Britain painted
grey, and that from the United States painted
red; the Latin Argentine is naturally attracted
to the red, even though its merits be inferior.
Hundreds of millions sterling are to be expended
in public works during the ensuing few years,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
and British contractors should be awake to
the possibilities. Belgian contractors have already
been in the field, but their work has not always
been "up to sample," so that the present opportunity
is considerable.</p>

<p>Old residents directed my attention to a great
change which is taking place in the import houses
of Buenos Aires. Until a few years back it could
be said that the British were first and the rest nowhere.
British capital has flowed abundantly into
the country, but toward developing its natural
resources rather than in trade. Now German houses
have a strong footing in "B.A.," and, naturally
enough, they are encouraging the products of their
own land. Go into a German house, and it is German
wares that are for sale. Go into a British house,
and you find United States and German wares as
well as English being offered. I was seriously convinced,
whilst studying the trend of trade in Argentina,
that it is absolutely necessary that the managing
heads of English firms who have dealings with South
America, and find they are not getting that share
of the increased trade which the growth of the
country warrants, should make periodic visits to
Argentina to learn for themselves what is the matter.</p>

<p>If there is one complaint to be made against
the Englishman trading with a foreign land, it is
his lack of adaptability. So long as he had the
manufacturing of the world in his own hands, he
could do as he liked. The thing he made was good,
and it was the only thing. Now he has keen competitors,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
and the customer has a varied choice. The
Englishman has to consider whether it is worth his
while to give the exaggerated credit which manufacturers
elsewhere are prepared to give if they can
secure the orders. The Argentine likes long credit.
Then, is he prepared to make an inferior, showy
article at a cheap price? These are two considerations
which count enormously with the Argentine.
You can purchase the best Sheffield cutlery in the
best shops, for it is what the better-to-do people
insist on having. But there are millions of people in
the Republic who have never heard of Sheffield, and,
therefore, know nothing about its reputation. What
they want is cheap knives. Sheffield firms do not
make these, and the consequence is the majority of
the people have rubbish from elsewhere. I am not
advocating that the British manufacturer should
drop making the things which have won for him and
his country a worthy reputation. I am pointing
out some of the things which must be well thought
about if Britain is going to keep its pre-eminence
in the financial value of the goods imported into
Argentine.</p>

<p>Further, an Argentine when he orders anything
wants it at once. Quick delivery is an essential.
Finally, all catalogues should be in Spanish, and all
prices in Argentine currency. No man who goes
out to "chase up business" in securing orders
should be without a knowledge of Spanish. Talking
through an interpreter is no good. The personal
touch is lost. Spanish is a language much neglected
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
in England. I can think of no more profitable investment
for a young fellow of parts, wanting to
enter commercial life, and without means to go
into business as a principal, than thoroughly to
master Spanish.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

<h3>CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COUNTRY</h3>


<p>It is well to get a bold, broad idea of the country.
It covers 2,000,000 square miles. England is just
about one-tenth that size. It is double the size of
Mexico.</p>

<p>In the far north you are in the torrid tropics.
In the far south you need a heavy coat, even in
high summer-time. Its conditions may, therefore,
be described as variable. No other country can
give you such change.</p>

<p>The 20,000 miles of railway run through most
of the flat fertile areas, and the ordinary traveller
comes away with the idea it is one of the most level,
featureless countries he has ever been in. The old
settlers had the same idea, for their description
<i>pampa</i> applied to a boundless stretch. You can
journey for hundreds of miles and never see a tree.
But up in the north, under the shadow of Brazil,
are great forests which will be made useful to the
world one of these days. Then you get the backbone
of the continent in the west, the Andes with
Aconcagua rising to 23,000 feet above sea level.
In the middle land is the fruitful Argentine Mesapotamia.
In the far south is the last word of desolation,
the Patagonian wilderness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>Argentina has several navigable rivers, and two,
the Plate and the Parana, up which it is possible,
for light draft steamers, at any rate, to go hundreds
of miles. If one pretends there is no Amazon in
existence the Plate discharges more water into the
ocean than any river from Hudson's Bay to the
Magellan Straits. A learned book informs me that
the volume of water rolled into the ocean is 2,150,000
cubic feet per second, which seems "prodigious." At
Monte Video the width of the river is sixty-two miles;
so it is no trifling creek. The Plate is the muddiest
stream I have ever come across. This is not to be
wondered at, considering that it and its tributaries
scour many thousands of miles. As a matter of fact,
the estuary is being filled up. Within knowledge,
the depth opposite Monte Video has lessened by
fifteen feet, and though dredgers are constantly at
work, big liners moving up to Buenos Aires have
sometimes to force a way through two feet of mud.
It is quite likely that in the fullness of time Buenos
Aires will not be a port, but an inland town.</p>

<p>Sometimes Argentina has floods which ruin the
crops, drown thousands of cattle, break the railway
banks, and reduce strong men, who thought they
were rich, to tears at the prospect of poverty. Or
there are droughts which shrivel everything up.
Away back in the 'thirties, Buenos Aires Province
had a drought which lasted for five years. Scientists,
who know all about these things, say that the rainless
zones are extending, and that in the far future
the whole Republic will be a rainless zone, and
umbrella sellers will go into the bankruptcy court.
The prospect is not immediate, and if we are wise
we shall not worry over a trouble which may have
to be faced five hundred years hence.</p>

<p>Considering you can get a sweep of level country
for 2,000 miles, with scarcely a hill that would make
a decent bunker, when a gale gets on the rampage
it runs away with itself. There is the <i>zonda</i>, which
so disturbs the elements that the thermometer jumps
fifty degrees in about as many minutes. Then,
although there are those millions of cubic feet of
water emptying itself out of the Plate, there comes
the <i>suestadas</i>, which blows so hard that the water
cannot get into the ocean, and, as a result, the upper
streams rise and tumble over their banks. Next
there are the <i>pamperos</i> on the plains, which either
grill you with their heat or give you a chill from their
rawness. I did not suffer myself; but these hateful
<i>pamperos</i> are so charged with electricity that they
give you a shock which produces a sort of paralysis,
"perhaps twisting up a corner of the mouth, or
half closing one eye, or causing a sudden swelling
of the neck," as one authority records.</p>

<p>Parts of the Republic are yet to be explored.
Persistent man is having a rough time in the Chaco
region. When our ancestors invented hell they had
no knowledge of the Chaco. It is all swamp and
forest, and mammoth mosquitoes and fever, and
pestiferous Indians who do not like the white man,
and put a spear into his back whenever they get
the chance. The Chaco Indians are amongst the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
few of their race who have not been subjugated.
There are rivers which come trailing from goodness
knows where; but when they reach the Chaco they
are evidently so disgusted that they burrow underground.
When it rains, fish several inches long
drop from the clouds. Under a torrent a dip in
the ground will become a pool, and in it will be found
fish a foot long. They do not drop from the clouds.
There are no little streams by which they can have
arrived. Where do they come from? The easiest
explanation offered is that they were formerly much
smaller, did arrive on a storm cloud, and have been
lying in the mud since the last storm.</p>

<p>I heard yarns, vouched for, but which seem like
travellers' tales. There is a little bird which sits
on a branch and twitters. Others come round, and
are apparently mesmerised. Then the little bird
attacks one, maybe much bigger than itself, and kills
it without any resistance being offered. There is
another bird which lives on friendly terms with the
Indians, hops in and out of their mud huts, and is
known as the "watch bird," because it always raises
a peculiar cry when a stranger approaches.</p>

<p>In its physical aspects the Chaco is strange, with
swamps, arid plains, and mighty clumps of forest.
Here grows the quebracho, which means the break-axe;
so it is a very hard wood. It is to get this
wood that companies have men working in the Chaco,
hundreds of miles from even a vestige of civilisation.
Bullocks are employed to drag the trunks, and the
poor beasts have a bad time of it. Then there are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
light railways to carry the trunks to the mills.
Originally the quebracho was sought because it made
serviceable and long lasting "sleepers" for railroads.
Now it is chiefly wanted for the tannin in
it; it is said to contain 50 per cent. of tannin.</p>

<p>Mention has been made of singular birds in the
Chaco. But there are others to be found elsewhere
in Argentina. W. H. Hudson, in his instructive
book "The Naturalist in La Plata," describes the
ypecaha, which holds public meetings and has
dancing performances. "A number of ypecahas,"
he says, "have their assembling places on a small
area of smooth, level ground, just above the water
and hemmed in by dense rush beds. First one bird
among the rushes emits a powerful cry, thrice repeated,
and this is a note of invitation quickly
responded to by other birds from all sides as they
hurriedly repair to the usual place. In a few moments
they appear to the number of a dozen or twenty,
bursting from the rushes and rushing into the open
space and instantly beginning the performance.
There is a screaming concert. The screams they
utter have a certain resemblance to the human
voice, exerted to its utmost pitch and expressive of
extreme terror, frenzy and despair. A long, piercing
shriek is succeeded by a lower note as if in the
first the creature had wellnigh exhausted itself.
Whilst screaming, the birds rush from side to side,
as if possessed by madness, the wings spread and
vibrating, the long beak wide open and raised vertically.
This exhibition lasts three or four minutes,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
after which the assembly peaceably breaks up."
Quite like a political meeting at home.</p>

<p>European domestic animals have thrived since
their introduction, though there is a tendency,
checked by the constant introduction of breeding
stock, to develop local characteristics. This has
been particularly remarked in sheep which have
strayed and have been left to themselves for several
generations. They grow bigger and bonier, and with
their leanness comes the power of rapid movement,
so that their flesh is scant and their wool has an
inclination toward growing straight and stiff like the
hair of a goat. In the outlands of Argentina
ostriches, jaguars, and deer may be seen; but you
can live for years on the prairies&mdash;and that is where
most of the colonisation is going on&mdash;and never
catch a glimpse of one of these.</p>

<p>The thing which lays hold of the seeing man, after
he has remembered the ages during which the country,
suitable for maintaining innumerable millions of men
and beasts, lay dormant, is the way the land has
been completely transformed in its inhabitants,
human and animal, and how alien vegetation has
found a thriving home. The early Spanish adventurers,
as has already been told, had to start their
settlement by bringing animals from Spain, and it
was chance, the extraordinary reproductiveness of
herds which strayed or were abandoned, which
taught them they had come into possession of something
more valuable than gold mines. Books of
history chiefly deal with the lust and the cruelty
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
of the early Spaniards. I have nothing to do
here with the story of the way in which Spain
conquered the land. We have not to lose sight
of the fact, however, they began settling in these
parts nearly four hundred years ago, when a voyage
to the Americas was like a journey to another
planet, when the ships were small and incommodious
and dangers were great, and the world had no experience
in the science of colonisation. The authorities
freely gave tracts of land, but in their wisdom
they always stipulated that European domestic
animals should be introduced. A settler got land for
wheat and maize and an orchard, and then more
land, just in proportion to how many horses, cows,
sheep, pigs, and goats he would introduce. The
land could be obtained for nothing, but always on
condition that it was put to its full use in the maintenance
of stock. That was a rough and ready, and
yet very statesmanlike procedure. The best incentive
was given to the agriculturist and breeder.
The more cattle he introduced the more land he
put to the plough, the bigger was the grant given
to him by the authorities. Thus possession and
prosperity advanced hand in hand. Here is a lesson
which might be learnt to-day and copied by such
countries as Australia, where there are millions of
acres of undeveloped territory.</p>

<p>Time came when the wild herds waxed so numerous
that the local councils proclaimed that all such
cattle were the public property of their own people.
To prevent those who lived under another local
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
council taking possession, the system of branding
these cattle, when they could be caught, was introduced.
When the cattle thief came on the scene,
and he was got hold of, he was first branded on the
shoulder and for subsequent offences branded in the
hand, flogged and hanged. The straying cattle in
a district belonging to the public, the public soon
began to appreciate that here were cheap meat and
cheap hides. They were hunted as the buffalo were
subsequently hunted in North America, and it really
seemed as though they were going to be exterminated.
Regulations had to be made limiting the
number of animals to be killed every year. Though
there was still great slaughter, the herds continued
to multiply amazingly, and, of course, wandered
hundreds of miles away from any settlements. So
the tide rolled on until two hundred years ago the
number of cattle had increased to many millions.
Carlos Gervasini, a Jesuit missionary, writing from
Buenos Aires in 1729, says, "So numerous are the
cattle in the neighbouring <i>campo</i> here that any
landlord may take from ten to twelve thousand to
breed from, merely for the trouble of lassoing them
and driving them home. In order to take more
than this number a special licence is required from
the governor. The ships returning to Spain are
filled with the hides, and none but good specimens
of these are troubled about. As to the flesh, each
man takes what he requires and leaves the rest to
the jaguars and dogs." Some years later a visitor
to Argentina said there were so many cattle that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the plains were covered; and had it not been for
the number of dogs which devoured the young the
country would have been devastated by them.
There were so many cattle that when the Spaniards
were at war, and invading boats appeared, their
custom was to drive vast herds pell-mell down the
river bank and so prevent a landing.</p>

<p>See the extraordinary whirligig. First no cattle.
Then land granted to settlers who would introduce
cattle. Then so many cattle they could be had by
anyone for the asking, and this followed by wholesale
slaughter, the extermination so thorough that a
halt had to be called. Then further amazing multiplication,
till the increasing wild dogs played havoc
with the young animals. Then the dogs got so
numerous, and their ravages so extensive, that
soldiers were sent out to wage war on the canine
pests. They killed untold thousands, but the people,
instead of being grateful, chaffed the soldiers and
dubbed them the "dog killers." The dogs started
to increase again, faster than the cattle, but men
refused to go out and kill the dogs when the only
reward was to be nicknamed "dog killer." So the
dogs were left alone, and they kept down the number
of cattle. It was not till fifty years ago that a
systematic massacre of the wild dogs took place,
because just then the Argentines were beginning to
settle down to scientific breeding.</p>

<p>It is astonishing how few dogs there are in Argentina.
The dog may be the friend of man in other
parts of the world, but not in Argentina. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Argentine hates the dog. In Buenos Aires the
police have order to arrest every dog, whether it
is with anyone or not. During the time I was
in "B.A." I saw only one dog, and that was the
property of Sir Reginald Tower at the British
Legation.</p>

<p>That is not all the story. Not only did the
wild dogs develop a taste for young calves, but
the native Indians began to show a fondness for
horseflesh. For centuries, although he could have
had any number of cattle and nobody would have
objected, the Indian maintained a preference for
horseflesh. Then, suddenly, his fancy extended to
cattle. When he started rounding up the cattle
of the Spaniards there was trouble. Sheep were
prolific, but mutton was contemptible food. None
was so poor as to be obliged to eat mutton. The
Spaniards regarded mutton much as Englishmen
now regard horseflesh. The only use of a sheep was
for its wool and fat. But the prejudice against mutton,
after lasting for nearly three hundred years,
finally disappeared.</p>

<p>Whilst there was an increasing carrying trade
from Buenos Aires to Spain of skins, wool, and
tallow&mdash;very profitable merchandise&mdash;Spain officially
was not enthusiastic over this mean trading. What
she wanted was gold and silver. As these came from
Peru and Chili those countries were favoured whilst
Argentina was the Cinderella of the family. What
good was a country that had no mines but only
grass to feed horses and cattle and sheep?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>We think differently in these days, but in those
far-off times Spain scarcely condescended to recognise
Argentina. It was darling Peru that was always
favoured. All regulations in regard to trade were
made favourable to Peru. Spain accepted what she
fancied from Argentina, and hampered her in seeking
other markets.</p>

<p>Nothing, however, could stop the advance of
Argentina. It was with reluctance that Argentina
was raised to the first rank as a province, and was
given liberty to export where she liked. Her trade
jumped ahead. Then Argentina not only killed to
get hides and wool and fat, but she had to begin
breeding in order to supply the European demand.
She began to dream dreams. There was little immigration;
the people were the descendants of the old
settlers. They knew nothing of Spain. They had
no recollection of ancestors who did know anything
of Spain. Spain meant nothing to them but a
distant country which once lorded them and presumed
to dictate to them. It was resentment
at the relationship, combined with a desire to
fulfil an independent destiny, that brought about
the revolution and the declaration of a republic
in 1810.</p>

<p>Since then Argentina has had many internal
political troubles. She has had her set-backs. But
the ebb has always been succeeded by a tumbling
flow of fortune. The breed of cattle has been marvellously
improved. The number of animals now
runs into hundreds of millions. Vast areas now wave
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
with wheat and maize. As you journey through
Argentina, and see the land smiling with success,
you know that beyond your gaze are thousands of
square miles of soil as virgin as in the days when
the Indians roamed free.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

<h3>"CABBAGES AND KINGS"</h3>


<p>One of the failings of new countries, like that of
youth generally, is conceit. Yet, on second thought,
it is a useful offence, for it carries a people light-heartedly
over rough ground which older nations
dare not face and so turn aside.</p>

<p>In the new lands the settlers have the constant
panorama of achievement before their eyes. They
remember things as they were ten years ago, see
them now, and are convinced that nowhere in the
world has such progress been made as they are
making. Anybody who hints a doubt is scowled
upon. And the buoyancy of spirit, a sort of rampant
optimism about themselves, is fostered by a
bent of mind to read about what goes on in "rotten
old Europe." A gracious Providence helps them to
take notice only of the good things in their own
country, and to have a quick eye for the bad things
in other countries. Further, as all new lands need
settlers, the official flag-waving and trumpet-blowing
to attract immigrants is garish. You can, as a
rule, reduce the value of the advertisements by half,
and still be quite sure that more than justice
remains.</p>

<p>I have been induced to write the preceding paragraph
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
because, as I am not a hired agent to proclaim
the wonders of Argentina, but merely a man who has
studied some of its capabilities on the spot, I have
no desire, in my endeavour to give a true portrait,
to ignore the warts and occasional blemishes. Of
course, the Argentine thinks his land the most remarkable
in the world. In many respects I am
disposed to agree with him. But it is not without
spot. For instance, the first thing he is enthusiastic
about is the climate. The freedom from severe winters,
with the possibility for cattle to remain in the
open all the year round, is an advantage. But in
the Argentine winter (our summer) there are cold,
wretched, rainy days which are depressing. In
their summer (our winter) the heat is sometimes
intense, especially in the northern region. I know
of the fine, clear, bracing climate of the plains, filling
one's veins with energy and the joy of living.
I have enjoyed the charm of Mendoza, the healthiest
of all the towns in the Republic. Where I am
inclined to part company with the Argentine is when
he wants to argue that the climate of the whole
country is adorable.</p>

<p>Take Buenos Aires. The new arrival is not only
entranced with the development and the encircling
beauty of the city, but, with continuous blue skies
and glorious sunshine, he is prone to underline the
usual nice things about the climate. Then, one day,
he feels uncomfortable, limp, saggy in body and
mind. The slight breeze is from the north, and it
seems to bring heavy inertia from the Brazilian
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
forests. The old inhabitants have probably got used
to the "norther"&mdash;they show no diminution in
vigour&mdash;but the muscle-slackening and wearying
effect on the new-comer is undoubted. Most of
Buenos Aires is built on low-lying ground, much of
it reclaimed from the shallow Plate, and the air
is relaxing. Though the sun is delightful, it is anything
but invigorating. So you reach the conclusion
that, whilst Buenos Aires has usually most delightful
weather, it has an indifferent climate.</p>

<p>There are striking changes in temperature in
Argentina. Within half an hour of being broiled
you may feel as though you had passed into a refrigerator.
Hurricanes sometimes sweep vast areas,
and everything&mdash;trees, buildings, crops&mdash;are mown
down by the blasts. In the sandy stretches the sand
is swept up like a thick cloud, and, though <i>estancieros</i>
shut every door and fasten every window, it is not
long before every room has an inch depth of sand.
I have travelled all night in a sleeping car with
double windows to resist the sand, but it filtered
through nevertheless, and in the morning I found
the only white spot in the compartment was where
my cheek had rested on the pillow.</p>

<p>Life on a ranch has the glamour of romance about
it. The town-bred Englishman, dissatisfied with his
lot, lets his fancy roam to the prairies of North
America or the pampas of South America, and his
imagination glows with the conjured picture of cowboy
life&mdash;quaintly dressed, always well-mounted, and
with nothing to do but ride over the plains rounding
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
up wandering cattle. As I have explained in an
earlier chapter, many of the large <i>estancias</i> are not
occupied by their owners; a manager with a salary
is put in charge, and he usually has several young
Englishmen as assistants. There are a number of
peons. The manager, usually married, has a decent
house. The assistants have a plain, bachelor
establishment, and live in common. The peons
rarely have anything better than ramshackle
quarters. Distances are enormous. Frequently,
outside the little clump of trees which is the
distinguishing feature of all <i>estancias</i>, there is
nothing to be seen as far as the eye can range but
featureless prairie. The railways may be many
miles away. The country has comparatively few
towns&mdash;really a good point about an agricultural land&mdash;and
though they are all attractive, only Spanish
is spoken. Months may elapse between the visits
of an Englishman to a town. He has to rise early; he
has to work hard; the glamour of cowboy life soon
goes; he and his mates have told each other all
their stories; visitors are rare; there is practically
no women's society. At first the tendency is to be
homesick. But in time the man gets used to the life;
possibly he may be happy. He, however, is far
removed from refining influences. He may have a
fondness for reading, but life in the saddle is so hard
that at night, after supper and receiving instructions
from the "boss" for the next day, and having a chat
over work, there is little disposition to do anything
except have a game of cards, and then turn in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>It is no unusual thing for an <i>estancia</i> to be fifty
miles square. If so, it is divided into three or four
sections, with a manager over each. Even then the
property to be looked after is extensive. Though
for food there is plenty of beef and mutton, there is
little variety. The men are out by four in the
morning, and breakfast is often no more than biscuits,
washed down with maté (native tea). There
is a solid meal about eleven o'clock, generally boiled
meat, by no means always attractively served.
After dark, between seven and eight o'clock, there
is supper: meat, coffee, and biscuits. The surroundings
are coarse and dirty, and sometimes
disgusting. Of course, conditions are occasionally
much better than these; but I think I am fairly
describing the average quarters of the young Englishman
who goes out to Argentina to be assistant on
an <i>estancia</i>. What gave me frequent surprise was
not that the life roughened them, but that so
many retained the kindly courtesies of their homes
in England.</p>

<p>The great thing is that the life is healthy. As
years pass it gets a grip of a man, so that even if
he has the chance to return to civilisation he generally
prefers the camp. There is the driving of
cattle to the railway and loading them&mdash;often difficult
work&mdash;into the trucks to take them to the
freezing factories. There is the cutting of alfalfa and
the shearing of sheep. There is breaking-in of colts
and looking after the stock.</p>

<p>A neighbouring <i>estancia</i> may be twenty miles
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
away. But Sunday is a holiday, except for absolutely
necessary work, and men will start off at
two o'clock in the morning to have a jollification with
friends, generally to witness some horse-racing, about
which all the <i>estancias</i> for fifty miles round are
excited, and with a bottle of beer as first prize.
Maybe once or twice a year a wandering parson
drops into an <i>estancia</i>. Whatever be the religious
views of the hands&mdash;supposing they have any&mdash;the
visitor is well received, and, be he Roman Catholic
or Protestant, he proceeds to "fill them up." He
brings them something they do not often think
about. At the least he is a diversion. Undoubtedly
his praying and preaching have an effect, because
for several days after he has gone the men are serious,
and language is not quite so ruddy as formerly.
Then arises the question of the rival merits of horses
over a level two miles, and the trend of thought
changes.</p>

<p>The rural roads, as I have said, are shocking,
especially after wet weather, for they are no more
than tracks across mother earth. But man is an
adaptable creature, and the Englishman gets used
to the bad roads. The very discomforts facilitate
companionship. No man out on the road and needing
a meal has the slightest hesitation about dropping
into an <i>estancia</i> and making himself at home.
Young fellows will spend their money; and, as they
cannot get rid of it after the way of the towns, it
goes in buying horses to race or ponies for polo;
because if there are a dozen youngsters within
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
hail they invariably form a polo club. Folk think
nothing of travelling across country many miles to
witness a polo match on the Sunday. Usually the
matches take place at different <i>estancias</i> on successive
Sundays, and if there should be a homely English
girl about&mdash;well, she receives as much attention as
a real beauty would get in Mayfair.</p>

<p>Where two or three men are gathered together
in England the odds are that conversation will turn
to golf. Wherever men living in Argentina meet,
be they Spanish, Italian, or English, they talk about
horse-racing. I cannot recall that I ever met a
man in the Republic who was not interested in horse-racing.
I have already described what goes on at
Palermo. But besides the swagger races at Palermo,
and the races amongst the natives, the English like
to have their camp races every few months. Not
only is there the excitement of the contests, but
there is real warmth in the hearts of men meeting
old friends. Everybody knows what every horse has
done; everybody is acquainted with the riders.
There is betting, but nothing like to the same extent
as amongst the born Argentines, who are gamblers,
every mother's son, and will bet on anything and
everything.</p>

<p>Sometimes one reads in English newspapers and
telegrams how, on the arrival of emigrant ships in
Australia and New Zealand, there is hustling amongst
the ladies of those countries to get hold of the girls
who are arriving as domestic servants. Every new
country has its domestic servant problem, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Argentina is no exception. Unless wealthy, most
people in the towns live in small flats, which is
partly due to the excessive house rent, but also because
servants are scarce and dear. The foreigner
who has to make shift with an Argentine servant is
either driven mad or deserves a medal for an angelic
temper. I confess that at Cordoba I did meet with
an English family who had nothing but praise for
their native servants. But mostly I had to listen
to tragic stories of dirtiness, theft, and unblushing
lying. The trouble with so many of these Latins
is that, even when willing, they seem quite incapable
of learning. Of course, this applies to the
lowest classes. When you get amongst the business
folk you find they are quite as cute as North Americans&mdash;as
the Argentines always speak of the people
of the United States. After having a dozen incompetent
servants in twelve unhappy months, many
an English housewife ceases her search for a decent
servant and does the work herself.</p>

<p>There may be a Merchandise Marks Act in Argentina.
What I am quite sure about is, that it is the
very paradise of the faked imitation article. There
are certain things in Europe, be they mineral waters,
or field-glasses, or razors, which are well known.
It is possible to get the real thing in Buenos Aires,
but it is six to one you get a faked article. The
Argentines fake French wines of well known <i>châteaux</i>.
You pay a big price expecting to get a good cigar,
and more likely than not you get a brand with a
well-imitated band. All the well-known Scotch
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
whiskies are imitated, and there are half a hundred
"famous" whiskies that are never heard of outside
the Republic. I searched the whole of Buenos
Aires to get some briarwood pipes made by well-known
manufacturers. I was offered pipes bearing
their names, but they were all fakes. "Sheffield"
cutlery is often the shoddiest product of Germany.
England has still a reputation for turning out a first-class
article, but my experience was corroborated
by men I consulted in Buenos Aires; it was impossible,
or exceedingly difficult, to get the genuine
thing. I am not going to write that Argentina is
responsible for the shiploads of imitation muck
which is dumped upon her shores. But there are
certainly some manufacturers in some parts of the
world who make cheap and nasty things, affix well-known
English names, and do an enormous business
in exporting them to the Republic.</p>

<p>The "fool" Englishman is to be encountered on the
boats sailing to the Argentine. He does not read the
newspapers, except the sporting columns, and "books
are so dull"; but somebody has told him Argentina
is a wonderful place with no end of "stuff" to be
picked up. So with a first-class ticket to "B.A.,"
and enough cash in his pocket to keep him at the
Plaza Hotel for a fortnight, he hopes to make his
fortune.</p>

<p>"No end of Johnnies make lots of money," he
explains as a preliminary to proceeding to do the
same himself.</p>

<p>"What do you intend to do?" is quietly asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, anything. I think I'd like to go on one of
those <i>estancia</i> things; awfully jolly riding about
all day rounding up beastly bullocks."</p>

<p>"Got any letters of introduction?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I've got two from a fellow at my club,
awfully decent sort, who met a couple of ripping
Argentines in the Riviera summer before last, but
smelling with gold. They ought to put a chap in
for something worth having; what?"</p>

<p>That is not a fancy picture. I have met two of
that type in one voyage, and the above is a fairly
good example of their hopes and credentials. Without
any qualification they land in Buenos Aires and
have the haziest knowledge what they propose to
do next. Possibly they have some vague ideas
that wealthy Argentines will be down at the wharf
eager to help good-looking young Englishmen. The
young Englishman proceeds to use his letters of
introduction, and finds that one of the men is in
Europe and nobody ever heard of the other. What
next? The Englishman does not know. He cannot
speak a word of Spanish. He hangs round the
hotel lounge, and spends a lot of time in the American
bar downstairs. At the end of four days he confides
to you he is "fed up with the stinking hole,"
and has wired to the "old man" to send him enough
"stuff" to take him home. Then at the end of a
week he returns to England in the same boat as
that by which he arrived, quite convinced Argentina
is a place which he was jolly lucky to get out of.</p>

<p>There was another young fellow, somewhat more
spry than the example I have given. I met him
in the street one morning, and he was furious. He
had been in the running for the secretaryship of an
English company that had some big contracts in
Argentina, and he had been ruled out at last because
he did not speak Spanish. That was his grievance.
He knew he could mess along somehow, and could
always get somebody to explain if he had to talk
business with an Argentine who did not speak
English; so what was the good of having to swat
to learn the lingo?</p>

<p>One of the biggest financiers in Argentina told
me one day that whilst plenty of young Englishmen
made their way&mdash;indeed, if competent, they
were preferred to other foreigners&mdash;he was astonished
at the way others missed their opportunities.
My friend, an Englishman himself, but who has
lived all his life in the country, and speaks Spanish
more fluently than he does English, has his finger
in many concerns. Young men who have come out
to posts, and are not making the progress they
hoped, go to him to see if he can give them a helping
hand.</p>

<p>"Delighted," he says; "I want to help my own
countrymen as much as possible. How long have
you been in 'B.A.'?"</p>

<p>"Eight years."</p>

<p>"Then you speak Spanish like an Argentine,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;er&mdash;no; but I've picked up enough to
scrape along on."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Could you take charge of a hundred Argentines
and talk business to them as well as an Argentine?"</p>

<p>"No; I wouldn't like to say that."</p>

<p>"Could you write a technical business letter in
Spanish?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not."</p>

<p>"Good day, my young friend. I should have
been glad to have helped you, but I want a man
who would not be sure to make mistakes."</p>

<p>There is a number of that pattern of Englishman
in Buenos Aires. There are excuses for them. They
go out under a three- or a five-years' contract to
some post. A lad is a stranger in a strange land,
and has yet to pick up Spanish. He naturally consorts
with his own countrymen. They dine together;
they meet in the same café; they belong to the
same club; they seek their pleasures together. It
is very hard for a fellow under such circumstances
to become quick with the language, or extend his
knowledge to any great extent as to the Argentine
way of doing things. He can get all his requirements
with a sort of pidgin-Spanish. So at last he
does not bother. That is the kind of man who
sticks in the same position all his life, and occasionally
rails at his luck in not getting a big post.</p>

<p>That is one side of the picture. There is the
other. I have in my mind a man who holds a high
position in Argentina. When he went out twenty
years ago he saw that the first essential was to know
the language. At the risk of being thought unsociable,
he lived with Spanish Argentines for two
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
years, and made friends with young Argentines rather
than with Englishmen. He made it a habit to read
the Buenos Aires Spanish morning papers. He has
gone ahead and done exceedingly well, although I
would not describe him as a brilliant business man.
Then there was a youth with whom I made acquaintance
on the boat. I noticed he was spending a
good deal of his time with a Spanish grammar. He
told me he was going out under a five-years' contract
to be a clerk in one of the banks. "But I am not
going to stop a bank clerk," he confided to me,
"though that will be all right for five years. By
then I hope to have got a good grip of the language
and picked up something about Argentina, and if
then I'm not able to go to some boss and get one
of the good jobs, well, it will be my own fault."
With that spirit he would be a success. All over
the country I was meeting Englishmen of that
standard, and, because they can be relied upon,
they are esteemed and trusted.</p>

<p>But I am not going to sing the praises of Argentina
from a British immigrant's point of view. First of
all, take the case of the unskilled labourer, the
artisan, and the agriculturist. There is no man so
conservative in this world as the British working
man. He has an inherent contempt for all foreigners
when he gets close to them, chiefly because their
ways are not his ways. So the working man who
went out to Argentina would be handicapped by
not knowing the language; he would be confused
with the money; he would dislike the food; the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
way in which the working class lives out there would
disgust him. At the other end of the string is the
great capitalist. Capital knows no language, and
owes allegiance to no country. The capitalist with
shrewdness, intelligent anticipation, can make money
quickly; in no country can a man get so quick a
turnover of his capital as in this Republic.</p>

<p>Between these two classes is an army of men
who go into the railway service, into the offices
of great English firms, into banks. They get better
paid in Argentina, but living is three times as heavy
as at home. Take the case of a young friend of
mine. He had a situation in England at £200, and,
with his amusements, he had but little left over.
He got a situation in Argentina at £700 a year.
Living, more or less in similar style to the way he
did at home, cost him £400 a year. But he had
£300 a year over, and that was not £300 a year in
Argentine value, but £300 a year in English value,
because he was investing it for the time when he
would return to his native land.</p>

<p>Of course there are promotions and superior
posts to be obtained. Occasionally a man will break
away and get hold of something which will lead to
fortune. These cases, however, are the exceptions.
The great fortunes do not grow out of business, as
they do in the United States, for up to the present
Argentina is not to be reckoned with as a manufacturing
country. They come to men who have
colossal finance to manipulate. To the great financier
Argentina can give untold wealth. There are,
of course, cases of men who started with nothing,
and can now give their wives a £20,000 necklace.
But to the man who lands in Argentina with nothing
but his muscle, or a salaried job, although his position
will be improved, and he can save more than
ever he made in the Old Country, the chances are
against his ever joining the ranks of the nabobs.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

<h3>LIVE STOCK IN THE REPUBLIC</h3>


<p>The constant wonder to me, as I traversed the
fruitful prairies, was why Nature had not supplied
the country with indigenous live stock.</p>

<p>One would have thought that the forces of evolution
would have provided animals to benefit and
multiply. Man, of course, has done much to improve
the land. By the laying down of alfalfa he has
turned sandy regions into rich pasturage. By irrigation
he has converted wastes into prosperous
stretches. Still, there were thousands of square
miles, capable of maintaining great herds, for ages
before the coming of the Europeans. But Nature
was niggardly in raising animals which the adventures
of man subsequently proved suitable to the
soil.</p>

<p>The principal original animals were the alpaca,
which provided meat and wool, and the llama, used
as a beast of burden by the natives, though the
loads it could carry were slight. Spain, when she
took possession of the country, saw its disadvantages.
Though the Spanish Court was prodigal in giving
tracts of the new land to grandees and others, it
is significant that in practically all the concessions
was the provision that the grant failed unless horses,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
cattle, sheep, and goats were introduced. They
were for purely domestic uses.</p>

<p>A couple of centuries ago a bull and ten cows
were abandoned. What became of them troubled
no one. Long afterwards their descendants were
found grazing, and they had increased to many
thousand; now they have increased to many millions.
They were sturdy cattle, but too numerous for the
then exceedingly sparse population. Their hides,
however, were profitable for sending to Europe; and
many thousands of beasts were slain, and their carcases
left to rot, in order that their skins might
be sent across the seas. In 1794 merino sheep were
imported from Spain. In 1824 Southdowns were
imported from England. They made an excellent
cross, and that was the start Argentina got in the
growing of wool.</p>

<p>There was no discovery that this part of South
America was peculiarly suitable for European stock.
There was just a slow but increasing consciousness
of the fact that European animals were easily acclimatised,
and had a greater breeding capacity than
at home. The first European cattle did not come
direct, but dribbled in by way of Brazil from Peru&mdash;a
roundabout route. Indeed, for several centuries
Spain, which was mistress of that part of the world,
rigorously excluded all other countries from assisting
in its development or having any share in its
trade. Further, Peru, which was the most important
of the Spanish settlements, had sufficient power at
the Court of Spain to secure an insistence that all
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
goods entering South America should do so by the
door of Peru. You have only to glance at a map
to see how absurd it was that articles intended for
Buenos Aires or the east coast had to be shipped
to the Isthmus of Panama, taken across to the Pacific
side by mule caravan, shipped again down the coast
to Peru, and then sent thousands of miles over
mountains, through jungle and across uninhabited
plains, to their destination. This intolerable condition
of things, which Spain refused to change,
had much to do with Argentina's casting off the
yoke, in the beginning of the nineteenth century,
and declaring itself as a republic.</p>

<p>Though one hears much about the way Argentina
has gone ahead as a cattle-raising country during
the last decade, one must not lose sight of the fact
that the Spaniards have been rearing cattle there
for over three hundred years. Even when the
possibilities began to be realised there were no means
of land transport except by driving the beasts, and,
except for the hides and tallow and subsequently
the wool, there was little that could be sent to
Europe.</p>

<p>In the first half of the nineteenth century, however,
Argentina was beginning to find herself. The
Argentines were not content with the quality of the
animals which were bred haphazard. They took to
importing better strains from Europe, grasped what
pedigree meant, began to demand the best the world
could produce, and were willing to pay for it, until
the call of Argentina for pedigree stock has almost
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
become a mania, and other countries have little
chance when Argentina enters the market with her
bags of gold.</p>

<p>Not only was there a wonderful increase in
cattle and sheep, but horses multiplied. The Spanish
contempt for females extends to mares, and no self-respecting
Argentine, who was not seeking the sneers
of his countrymen, would think of riding a mare.
A hundred years ago European nations had not
thought of purchasing South American mares; and
it has been computed that in the first quarter of
the last century over 500,000 mares were mercilessly
slaughtered in Argentina. It has been said that
an enormous number of wild horses were at large,
and their continued incursions amongst the general
stock caused great loss to the breeders.</p>

<p>But that Argentina is one of the most productive
lands in the world for horses is undoubted. They
seem to have something approaching the fertility
of the Australian rabbit. Historians disagree as to
whether the first importation of horses to Argentina
in the sixteenth century were seventy-two horses
and mares, or forty-four horses and mares, or seven
horses and five mares. Anyway, whilst Ruy Diaz
de Guzman, who vouched for the latter figures,
wrote they had "attained such a multiplication in
less than sixty years that they cannot be counted,
because the horses and mares are so many that they
appear like great woods and occupy (the country)
from Cape Blanco to the fort of Gabato, rather
more than eighty leagues, and reach inland to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Cordillera," the monk Fray Juan de Rivadancira,
who declared for forty-four horses and mares, states
that "the coast is inhabited by a great many people,
and there is an immense number of horses that
remained there from the time of Don Pedro de
Mendoza, that is forty-five years ago, forty-four
horses and mares that have multiplied themselves,
but, strange to say, in all this time they have not
been seen by the Spaniards, who only know of them
from the reports of the Indians, who say that they
cover the plains to an astonishing extent." Allowing
for these tales being exaggerated, the very fact they
should be recorded some fifty years or so after the
first importation of horses shows there must have
been an astonishing increase.</p>

<p>Argentine breeders of cattle, knowing of the care
taken in Europe to improve quality, realised that
quantity was not sufficient. There would be little
merit in having millions of animals on the rich
grassed plains if commercially they were unable
to compete with other countries with their produce.
So between fifty and sixty years ago they began
methodically and scientifically to improve their herds.
The result was so satisfactory that owners of herds
conceived it to be their patriotic duty&mdash;and Argentina
is noisily patriotic&mdash;to raise the standard of quality.
The Argentine Agricultural Society was established.
It has increased in size and importance. Its offices
at Buenos Aires have the marks of energetic distinction,
whilst its permanent show grounds in the
suburbs of the city are the finest buildings for such
a purpose in the world. I will not say, as is often
said, that the display is the finest in the world.
Now and then it tops any other show in a particular
class. But it is a great show, provided by a country
with only seven million inhabitants; and, speaking
generally, it is not a bad second to any other, no
matter where it is held.</p>

<p>There is tremendous rivalry amongst breeders,
and the ambition to secure the blue ribbons is so
great that the Argentines, as I have mentioned
in a previous chapter, will not trust people of their
own race to act as judges. The judges all come
from Britain, and are men of recognised competence
and integrity. They are the guests of the Society.
They are provided with first class return tickets,
are entertained at the best hotel for three weeks,
have many courtesies piled on them, and each receives
£30 as out-of-pocket expenses. So keen are some
Argentine breeders to gain the coveted ribbon that
I have heard of their sending special representatives
to travel on the boat from Southampton to Buenos
Aires so that an amiable judge may be "nobbled."
Fortunately, British judges are not made that way;
and although stories of attempts are common,
there is no recorded instance of success.</p>

<p>I was present at the official opening of the show
in 1913 by the Minister of Agriculture. It was not
an enthusiastic occasion. The weather was bad and
cold, and there was the reading of two interminable
speeches from manuscript&mdash;read to about a score
of top-hatted and frock-coated gentlemen standing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
round, looking insufferably bored and never raising
the equivalent of a single "hear, hear," whilst the
crowds in the stands heard not a word but waited
patiently for the parade of prize winners to
begin.</p>

<p>But it was a show of cattle of which Argentina
had a right to be proud. It was another post along
the road of evolution. The time is yet far off when
Argentina can rightly claim first position amongst
the live-stock nations; but it is a goal which the
Argentines steadily keep in sight. Stud farms are
to be found all over the country. Prices which
formerly would have been thought reckless are now
willingly paid for stallions, bulls, and rams. Yet,
though the Argentine is pleased with himself, he
does not so much boast of what he has accomplished
as rhapsodise about the future. To-day (1914)
there are 8,000,000 horses in the country, 30,000,000
cattle, and over 80,000,000 sheep. Yet only a
portion of the country suitable for stock is utilised.
Everything indicates that within the next ten years
200,000,000 animals of all classes will be grazing
on the pastures of Argentina.</p>

<p>The love of horse-racing is bred in the bone of
every man in the country. All the big towns have
their race-courses. Out on the prairies, if there is
no race-course, the men at the <i>estancias</i> mark out
a track and race against each other's horses on
Sunday afternoons. An eye is kept on the famous
European race-horses, and as much as £40,000 has
been paid for a great winner, so that he may be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
used for stud purposes. The breeding of thoroughbreds
has become part of the national life of the
Republic. The Jockey Club at Buenos Aires, possessed
of an enormous income, has by the offering
of handsome prizes encouraged the breeding of
race-horses. The Argentine stud farms are, in
excellence of stabling and general surroundings,
lavish in luxury. So successful has been the breeding
from expensive European sires that European
breeders are now looking to Argentina to purchase
some of the sons.</p>

<p>But always, one must remember, the prosperity
of Argentina rests with her commercial cattle. As
England prohibits the landing of live cattle for
fear of foot-and-mouth disease, increasing attention
has been given to the business of exporting chilled
and frozen meat. The closing of British ports
and consequent slump in Argentine cattle gave a
colossal impetus to the frozen meat industry, so
that at the present time the Republic is the greatest
exporter of frozen meat in the world. That, perhaps,
is the reward for Argentina's being the first country
to export chilled and frozen meat to Europe. This
was as far back as 1877, though it was not until
1885 that the first freezing works were established.
To-day something like £11,000,000, mostly English
and United States capital, is sunk in Argentine
freezing houses. England is the largest consumer.
But though the quantity imported is enormous, it
is a mistake to suppose that frozen meat is yet
ahead of English home-killed meat. As a nation
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
we are increasing meat eaters. We are now consuming
something approaching two million quarters
a year. Only about a third of this is chilled and
frozen meat, and the consumption of home meat
is increasing, not decreasing.</p>

<p>That there is foot-and-mouth disease in Argentina
is undoubted. Though the Argentines protest we
continue the cry as an excuse for keeping out their
stock from our meadows and from competing with
our own fresh meat, I was quite convinced that
the disease does seriously exist in Argentina, and
that, whilst not so prevalent as occasionally alleged,
it is sufficiently bad to justify the British Board
of Agriculture in maintaining the prohibition. With
care, however, I am sure the Argentines could stamp
out the evil. Its persistence is due to carelessness.
The natural conditions of the cattle, being
out on the pastures all the year round, count for
healthiness. I have visited the great canned meat
establishments in Chicago, and when in Buenos
Aires and La Plata I inspected some of the biggest
of the Argentine freezing places. Though the latter
lacked the magnitude of the Chicago houses, I admit
my complete satisfaction with the sanitary conditions
surrounding what, to me, is always a sickening
business.</p>

<p>When a mob of cattle has been purchased the
seller gives a guarantee of the soundness of the
animals. When they reach the stock-yard the
veterinary surgeon of the company makes inspection
of each beast before it goes to the slaughter-house.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
The operation is the usual one: the animal is pole-axed,
then the carcase is conveyed on a truck to
a shed, where it is hung up, bled, disembowelled,
and skinned. The veterinary surgeon makes an
examination to see if he can detect disease. But
this is not enough; a piece of the meat, a few ounces,
is cut off, labelled, and sent to a laboratory, where
further experiments are made. There is much
greater care taken in these slaughter-houses of
Argentina in the case of chilled and frozen meat
than is usually taken at home in providing the
"roast beef of old England." The carcases are placed
in a chilling chamber, 34° Fahr., for twenty-four
hours. Then they are cut in two, each side wrapped
in a cloth, and taken into the refrigerator compartments
on board a steamer. Should the investigation
in the laboratory reveal disease the
carcase is burnt.</p>

<p>To the layman inclined to be confused between
the terms "chilled" and "frozen," it is well to
explain the difference. Frozen meat is that which
has been kept well below freezing point, and can
be kept for an indefinite time. Chilled meat is
not frozen, but it can be kept wholesome for some
weeks when in a low temperature. Chilled meat
is of better quality than frozen meat, and, as the
Argentine ports are within three weeks of Smithfield,
her produce has a distinct advantage over
that of countries farther away, where the journey
takes six weeks, and the meat cannot be kept chilled,
but must be frozen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>I am aware of the prejudice against chilled meat.
Yet I suspect that occasionally some of us, when
paying for the home article, are really receiving
the foreign meat, but we do not know the difference.
The chilled meat trade&mdash;a later development
than the frozen trade&mdash;has sprung into existence in
Argentina mainly during the last dozen years.
That which we get in London, whether from La
Plata, Buenos Aires, or Chicago, is of better quality
than the meat the Argentine or the American gets.
The explanation is that the best meat is exported
because it has to come into competition with British
beef, which admittedly is the best in the world.
The question, however, arises, what real detriment
is there to meat as the result of freezing? Professor
Rideal, of London University, who has made
various experiments, has gone so far as to declare
that the nutritive and digestive qualities of Argentine
frozen meat are superior to those of the best
freshly killed English meats, and that Argentine
chilled meats possess the same qualities as English
meat.</p>

<p>It was in 1880 that we began to receive frozen
meat in any quantity from the Argentine, and
year by year the quantity has increased. Other
European countries are in need of cheap meat, and
yet it is a singular fact that nine-tenths of the cold
storage meat of the world comes to England. Just
upon two hundred and fifty steamers are now engaged
in bringing chilled or frozen meat to England from
Argentina, Australia, and New Zealand. London
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
alone has thirty cold stores with a capacity for
storing 3,000,000 carcases of mutton. South America,
Australia, and New Zealand have seventy freezing
establishments, chiefly for the purpose of supplying
the British market. Satisfactory though that
market is, Argentina is not content. She is beginning
to import her chilled meat into the United
States. She is making a bid for the French market.
Professor Armand Gautier, of the Academy of
Science, of Paris, has stated that the French people
ought to eat a third more meat than they do. As
the French production is insufficient, he has urged
the importation of meat preserved by cold, because
it can be kept almost indefinitely, and because in
times of epidemic disease in live stock, or lack of
forage, and above all in time of war, it would lend
most important service.</p>

<p>For a long time, however, Continental countries
have been shy about foreign meat, chiefly, I believe,
because they were thinking of the interests of the
breeders at home. Frozen meat has, however, been
received in limited quantities in Italy, Switzerland,
and Portugal. The Austrian Government at first
restricted the importation to 10,000 tons, but as
the meat was popular the restriction was removed.
So, gradually, frozen meat of good quality, and
cheaper than native meat, is finding a way into
other European markets besides our own. The
German-Argentine Society, recently formed, has
been petitioning the German Parliament for the
admission of Argentine frozen meat. The considerable
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
consumption of frozen meat in England is
encouraging Argentina in her ambition to contribute
to the feeding of the immense artisan populations
in the industrial centres of the continent.</p>

<p>Now anyone who has been much at sea knows
about jerked beef. The preparation of salt beef in
the old sailing days was a great business, and Argentina's
first endeavour in the meat business was the
preparation of jerked beef, as it is called. It is
not going too far to say that it was this business
which opened the eyes of South Americans to the
potentialities of their country. But gradually the
trade got shifted to the neighbouring little Republic
of Uruguay, with Monte Video as the chief place
of export. A great many of the cattle killed in
Uruguay are bred in Argentina. The trade has
extended to Brazil. Brazil, however, still calls for
Argentine cattle. So although this dry-salting was
first practised in Argentina in South America, and
the trade has to a great extent been removed, Argentina
is getting benefit because she sells hundreds of
thousands of steers to the neighbouring republics.
During the last year or two there has been a distinct
movement in Argentina to recapture the trade.
There is a huge demand for jerked meat in Cuba&mdash;and
Argentina is after the business. Argentina has
both eyes on the whole of the West Indies, where
there are great negro populations who, it is supposed,
would welcome this cheap kind of meat. It can be
used in tropical regions where expensive cold storage
would be an impossibility. Besides, an inferior
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
standard of animal, scarcely suitable for freezing,
can be jerked.</p>

<p>The gigantic business in meat extracts carried
on by such firms as Bovril and Liebig has given
a cue to the wide-awake Argentine for another
outlet to his enterprise. Indeed, the preparation of
meat extract in Argentina to-day needs the killing
of 200,000 head of cattle a year, whilst those killed
for jerked beef are about three-quarters of that
number. Anyway, Argentines, whilst glad enough
to have foreign capital brought to develop their
resources, are now constantly asking themselves,
"Why do not we do all this?"</p>

<p>The fact is not to be overlooked that Argentina
has a population of 7,000,000 to feed as well
as to contribute to the feeding of the outer world.
The population of the city of Buenos Aires is a
million and a half. So, whilst it needs the killing
of 4,000 head of cattle every day to keep the Republic
supplied with meat, 1,800 of these are needed in
the capital.</p>

<p>England clings to old and sometimes unsatisfactory
ways. When I visited the abattoirs at Liniers I
thought it would be no bad thing if a number of
British municipalities sent a shipload of representatives
to Argentina to study up-to-date slaughter-houses.
One of the most important features of
Liniers is the veterinary pavilion, with rooms for
bacteriological and microscopical observations. There
are twenty veterinary surgeons who make it their
business to examine every carcase and stamp it
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
before it is permitted to be sold as food. The annual
entry at the abattoir is, in round numbers, 750,000
sheep, 100,000 pigs, and 1,250,000 cattle. Yet the
animals slaughtered for local consumption represent
only three-fifths of the beasts sold in Buenos
Aires, the rest going to the slaughter-yards attached
to the freezing houses. These animals are not reared
only in the province of Buenos Aires. Other provinces
supply cattle, Cordoba, Santa Fé, Entre Rios,
Corrientes, and further afield.</p>

<p>One of the most instructive places is the sheep
market, covering 500 acres. Not only are there
pens innumerable, but there are two galleries set
apart for sales so that buyers may obtain a quick
bird's-eye view of the stock offered. A police representative
is constantly on duty, keeping a lookout
that the marks are all right and preventing
sheep stealing. Ten sanitary inspectors make inspection
of sheep as they go along the gangway
or race. Any sheep showing signs of disease is
sent to the necropolis&mdash;supervised by the cattle
division of the Ministry of Agriculture&mdash;is killed
and examined. Over 4,000,000 sheep are inspected
every year. Of these nearly 3,000,000 go to the
freezing establishments and the others are either
for local consumption or are bought to be fattened.
On an average 4,000 railway wagons a month come
in to Buenos Aires filled with sheep.</p>

<p>More than once I was made conscious of the
deep disappointment amongst Argentine breeders
that there is an embargo in Britain against the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
importation of live stock. They insisted that if
there were disease it would show itself during the
three weeks' sea journey, so that British herd owners
should have no fear of their own cattle being contaminated.
The Argentines cannot get it out of
their minds that it is not fear of disease, but protection
for the British farmer which really actuates
the British Board of Agriculture. Notwithstanding
the increase in the sale of chilled and frozen meat,
the Argentines, of course, recognise that the Englishman
would prefer fresh killed meat if he could get
it at a sufficiently cheap price. The steady increase
in the price of home-grown meat in English shops
is noted, and all the strings possible are being tugged
in order to induce the British Government to relax.
Besides, there is a considerable body of opinion in
Great Britain itself, occasionally voiced in Parliament
by the representatives of industrial constituencies,
favourable to the importation of foreign
animals, of course under proper inspection. Were
admission granted, there would undoubtedly be a
fall in the price of meat. But, even eliminating the
natural antagonism of the British farmer, there is
the consumer to be considered. Without joining
in the combat whether Argentine meat is as good
as British meat, there can be no doubt that the
home buyer prefers the home article, and in innumerable
cases he is prepared to pay more for it.
There is the possibility, the danger if you like, if
live stock from Argentina were admitted, for certain
graziers to buy them, give them a week or two on
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
English meadows, and for the retail butchers, either
in ignorance or with the intention to mislead the
purchaser, to ticket the sides as "English fed."</p>

<p>Though Argentines grumble at the British ports
being closed to them, causing a slump in their export
of live stock, they acknowledge that the effect has
been counterbalanced by the increase in the export
of frozen meat. "Therefore why should they make
such a fuss?" may be asked. Simply because the
Argentines are eager to find an outlet for the productive
capacity of their country. They do not
rest on their oars. They are looking to the future.
There is no question in their minds what Argentina
can do. They do not want to be baulked by restrictions.
It may be argued that, whilst they are zealous
to secure freedom for their goods in oversea markets,
they do not show any inclination to give an equally
wide freedom to the goods of other countries in
their own markets. That, however, just shows that
considerations which often influence individual traders
do not disappear when the nation acts collectively.</p>

<p>The point to be marked&mdash;and it is the significance
of much in this chapter&mdash;is, that although other
new nations provide increasing amounts of meat,
Argentina is as alive as any of them to the growing
necessity for the industrial communities of Europe&mdash;constantly
increasing whilst agriculture stands
still or slides back&mdash;to look across the oceans for
their meat supply. The meat will be wanted. Competition
to supply it will be keen. In some European
countries the live stock is diminishing. Countries
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
which formerly did much business in supplying neighbours
have now enough to do to supply themselves.
Even Switzerland, unable to provide for her own
needs, and no longer able to get what she requires
from France and Italy, has turned to Argentina.
The doors are closed by some European Powers,
including Spain. But Argentina is keeping a watch
on the artisan classes in commercial Europe. She
expects the day will soon come when they will clamour
for cheaper meat, and break down the doors. When
that time does come, Argentina is determined to be
ready with a full basket.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

<h3>THE STORY OF THE RAILWAYS</h3>


<p>I think I have made it clear that, accepting Argentina
as an amazingly fertile country, it is the railways
that have chiefly been instrumental in making
it one of the most prosperous lands, with a big
part to play in providing food for the world. To-day
95 per cent. of its stock and produce is carried over
some part of the 20,000 miles of line representing
nearly £200,000,000 of British capital.</p>

<p>I remember riding in a coach attached to a
freight train across some hundreds of miles of sand
and sage bush, an impossible region from an agriculturist's
point of view.</p>

<p>"This is an unprofitable stretch," I remarked
to the railway official who was my companion.</p>

<p>"Not at all," was the reply; "you see, we have
a full load, and we get paid mileage, whether we
run through good or bad land."</p>

<p>That is one of the causes of railway profits in
Argentina: the enormous distances freight often
has to be carried.</p>

<p>It was not my lot to travel over all the railway
systems in the Argentine, but I travelled over the
most important of them, and from first to last I was
enthusiastic. The rolling stock is excellent; the
permanent way is better than over similar country
elsewhere, and as for the comfort of the passengers
it is certainly unsurpassed. Frankly, I often felt
like rubbing my eyes in order to make sure I was
"roughing it" in Southern America.</p>

<br /><br />


<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>

<p>Nowhere, out of Russia, have I seen the coaches
so admirably adapted for small or large parties.
You can have a section of a coach self-contained,
dining-room, bedrooms and bathroom, suitable for
families; and meals can be supplied from the buffet.
If you travel over a certain distance you cannot miss
having a buffet car; the law insists. Also the law
insists on dormitory coaches on the all-night journeys.
They are more commodious, because on most of the
lines the gauge is wider than in England. There is
none of the uncomfortable sleeping behind curtains,
with, maybe, a stranger in the bunk overhead, and
then having to wash in the smoking-room, which
the long-suffering men of the United States put up
with under the notion they possess the most luxurious
travelling in the world. When you come to
"special cars," a thing we know nothing about in
England except for royalty, the United States comes
first, but I would say Argentina is a close second.</p>

<p>Nothing could be jollier&mdash;when a sand storm is
not on the wing&mdash;than travelling with pleasant
friends in a reserved coach. It is like a flat. There
is a sitting-room, and on a chill evening the fire
burns brightly in an open grate. On a hot afternoon
you have your easy chairs out on the platform
at the rear and, with legs cocked up on the rail,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
you can smoke your cigar. You press a button,
and when the attendant has brought you an iced
cocktail you agree that "roughing it" in Argentina
is a delightful experience. If your car is properly
equipped with a good kitchen and a good cook,
and there is a decent "cellar"&mdash;hospitality is one
of the legitimate boasts of the people&mdash;you fare as
well as you would do in a first-class hotel. Were
it not that I might be thought a sybarite, I could
write like a chef about the menus I experienced and
enjoyed in my long excursions throughout the land.</p>

<p>"This is a nice chicken," I said to my host one
night. "Yes, we have a chicken run under the
car," he answered. I laughed, for I imagined the
innocent stranger was having his leg pulled; but
the next morning personal inspection assured me
there was a "run," in the shape of a long galvanised
screened box beneath the car.</p>

<p>It was pleasant to have a bedroom four times
the size of a crib on an English "sleeper," to have
a writing-table with electric light, and a bathroom
adjoining. But the chief joy of a special car was
that there was no changing to catch trains. Instructions
were given that we would stop at a certain
place at nine o'clock in the morning. The car was
detached and shunted into a siding. We lived on
the car and slept on it. Orders were given that
we were to be picked up by the 3.15 local train in
the morning, taken down a branch line forty miles,
attached to the express which would be coming
along at seven o'clock, and were to be released
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
somewhere else at 10.15 and put into a siding. I
lived this sort of life for nearly a month. It was
the best possible way of seeing the country.</p>

<p>Sometimes we travelled from point to point during
the night; sometimes we camped, as it were, at a
little wayside station, with the silence of the plains
around us except when a great goods train went
roaring by. We kept up the joke about "roughing
it." After a dinner party, when the coffee and
liqueurs were on the table, and the sitting-room was
pouring billows of cigar smoke from the wide-open
windows, we leaned back in our big chairs and hoped
that other poor devils who were "roughing it" in
the wilds were having no worse a time than we were.</p>

<p>Of course, the passenger traffic&mdash;except around
Buenos Aires&mdash;is a secondary consideration compared
with agricultural produce. It is estimated that the
area of land suitable for agriculture but not yet
cultivated is 290,000,000 acres, really all beyond the
zone of railway influence. At a greater distance
than fifteen miles from a railway station the cartage
of the produce becomes so expensive and difficult
that the profit disappears. Information supplied me
by the Argentine Agricultural Society shows that the
average cost of cartage is 0.70d. per mile per cwt.
Therefore, whoever has his farm farther than fifteen
miles from a station has to pay 10d. per cwt. for
cartage. Lands lying within the agricultural zone,
but distant more than fifteen miles from a railway
station, lose enormously in value, as they cannot
be utilised except for live stock. To find a means
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
of facilitating and cheapening the transport of cereals
would be to double the production and value of the
lands. The Agricultural Society thinks the solution
may lie in the construction of cheap auxiliary lines
of the simplest kind, which, laid down parallel to
the principal lines at a distance of nineteen to twenty-two
miles, or at right angles to them, would hand
over to cultivation considerable zones of valuable
fertile lands, and concentrate the produce in the
loading stations at a fair cost to the farmers.</p>

<p>The question is well asked, if the 20,000 miles
of rails are only sufficient to permit the cultivation
of 70,000,000 acres, how many will be necessary
when nearly 300,000,000 more acres are being worked?
At present about 1,000 miles of fresh railroad are
being laid down each year. £20,000,000 a year is
being put into new railroad construction. Yet thirty
years ago (1884) the total amount invested in Argentine
railways&mdash;now running into hundreds of millions&mdash;was
only £18,600,000. In 1885 all the railways in
the Republic transported cargo amounting to a
little over 3,000,000 tons. In 1905 it was over
12,500,000 tons. In 1913 it was moving toward
40,000,000 tons.</p>

<p>One harks back to the time of William Wheelwright,
who may be called the father of railways
in Argentina. It is three-quarters of a century
since he was shipwrecked at the mouth of the River
Plate. It was as a starveling that he got his first
knowledge of Argentina. He had come from the
United States, knew what railways were beginning
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
to do for the North, and dreamed what they ought
to do for the South. When he got back to the United
States he tried to interest his countrymen. But
the North Americans turned a deaf ear. There they
missed one of the greatest chances in their commercial
history. Had they seized their opportunities,
and come to South America with their adaptive
enterprise, the story of the relationship between the
United States and the Latin republics below them
would have been very different from what it is
to-day. Finding he could raise no capital in his
own country for railway enterprise in Argentina,
William Wheelwright came to England and interested
Thomas Brassey, one of our railway pioneers.
Brassey, Wheelwright, and others got capital, and
a little line out of "B.A." was built. Other little
lines were built. Bigger lines were built. There
were set-backs; occasionally the investing public
was shy. But, all told, for forty years a mile a day
of railroad was laid down in Argentina, and during
the last few years the rate has been three miles a
day. And it is all done by British capital.</p>

<p>Before I went out to this country I was conscious
of a certain apprehension in England that we had
rather too much money in Argentina, and that it
was about time we called a halt. The general average
of dividend during recent years has been a
fraction over 5 per cent., not much return for adventure
in a new country; but the fact is not to be
lost sight of that enormous extensions have been
provided out of revenue, as well as out of fresh
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
capital. That there is jealousy amongst considerable
sections of the young Argentines at the financial
interests which a foreign country like England has
in the Republic is undoubted. But it may be said
that the mass of the people recognise what they owe
to foreign capital, and although the Government
is inclined to increase the tightness of its grip on
railway administration, making bargains for lines
through uneconomic country in return for a concession
through fertile land&mdash;so that occasionally a
company will throw up a scheme rather than pay
the price by building in a region the Government
wants to be developed&mdash;I do not think it can fairly
be said that the Government is antagonistic to foreign
capital. The danger of foreign capital getting a hold
on Argentina in the way of extensive concessions is
sometimes preached; but the pouring of foreign
gold into the country brings too precious a return
to the Argentines themselves for any check to be
put upon it.</p>

<p>Besides, in strict fact, very little money is taken
out of the country in the way of dividend; the profits
are mostly thrown back to provide new works.
I have lying before me the returns of the four principal
railways for the year ending June 13th, 1913
(the Central Argentine, the Great Southern, the
Buenos Aires and Pacific, and the Western of Buenos
Aires). During the year the four companies expended
in additional capital £8,870,639, and the earnings
were £9,017,944, so that the investing public extracted
only £147,305, which is not a large draft
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
in return for the hundreds of millions invested. The
manner in which the earnings are thrown back into
the country for further development shows that,
despite the vague apprehensions in certain quarters,
the public confidence is still firm.</p>

<p>The Central Argentine Railway may first be
described, because not only does it date its origin
from the earliest times of railway enterprise in the
Republic, but it is one of the most up-to-date lines
in the world. At the head of it as general manager
is Mr. C. H. Pearson, young, shrewd, and, like most
strong men, a quiet man. When in England I hear
of lack of capability in railway management I think
of such a man as Mr. Pearson, who has won his spurs
at home, and by clear vision and steady, determined
action is successfully directing a company which
has 3,000 miles of railroad, most of it through rich
country. The line to-day is the offspring of amalgamations.
In the early 'seventies the Central Argentine
opened a line from the river port of Rosario to
Cordoba, two hundred and forty-six miles. Later
on Buenos Aires and Rosario were joined by another
railway company. Subsequently the two lines were
linked. Always, without halt, the line has pushed
its head into fresh country, until now its arms
stretch like a fan with Buenos Aires as the base.</p>

<p>I have heard Buenos Aires and Rosario described
as the London and Liverpool of Argentina&mdash;and the
illustration is apt. Rosario, to be pictured in a later
chapter, is a business and shipping centre, and
between the two towns there is a constant rush by
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
commercial men. It is inspiriting to see the rush
at the Retiro station in the early morning, when men
are busy getting their newspapers at the stalls and
hastening to the breakfast car and the roomy coaches.
To the eye of the newly arrived stranger there are
innumerable little differences from things he is accustomed
to at home. But they are matters of detail
to which you speedily get used, so that after a week
or two, or even a few days, you have a little start
in the realisation that you are not travelling in a
London and North-Western express, but amongst
a similar crowd of business men, in a far part of
the world, who are intent on their own affairs.</p>

<p>Twelve passenger trains journey daily between
Buenos Aires and Rosario. Until Mr. Pearson came
along with fresh ideas most of the passenger traffic
was by night. Trains left both places at ten o'clock;
the passengers went to bed, and early next morning
the destination was reached. Now there are two
day express trains completing the journey in just
under five hours. Only first-class passengers travel
by these trains, as excellent as the expresses between
New York and Philadelphia. There is nothing in
the way of scenery to move one to rapture; but
there is good agricultural progress on either side.
The line is being double tracked and stone ballasted,
and the running is comfortable. And sitting in this
train, thronged with business men, whilst the great
engine tears along to keep to scheduled time, you
understand something of the spirit of modern
Argentina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>Amongst the cities of the world Buenos Aires
takes thirteenth place in size. With its population
of a million and a half, long-distance electric tramcars
and the institution of an "underground"
system are not enough. High rents are driving
many thousands to the suburbs, and when, in the
morning, the rush of trains begins to deliver throngs
of men and women into the heart of "B.A.," the
scene is animated. All the big companies running
out of "B.A." are nursing their valuable suburban
traffic. The Central Argentine is electrifying over
forty-four miles of double track in the neighbourhood
of the city. This company, in the suburban section
of its system, now carries 15,000,000 passengers a
year. All the trains of the company run 889,000
miles a month. A handsome new station is being
erected on the site of the old Retiro. I was able to
inspect the latest pneumatic system of signalling.
When at Rosario I went over the extensive workshops,
and although it would be idle even to suggest
they compared with Crewe, Swindon, or Doncaster,
considering most of the parts are imported, they are
comprehensive works, and the machinery of the best.</p>

<p>Since Mr. Pearson has been in charge the Central
Argentine has taken to running excursions, and
encouraging the holiday makers in the flat lands to
go and seek bracing air in the Cordoba mountains.
Alta Gracia&mdash;of which more anon&mdash;an old Spanish
town which has been drowsing in the sun for several
centuries, is now one of the most popular of holiday
haunts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>But, though naturally enough the average passenger
considers a railway line from the way it
ministers to his needs, it is the goods traffic which
is of first importance to railways in a country like
Argentina. I went on the Central Argentine line as
far north as Tucuman, and as far west as Cordoba
and Rio Cuarto, and beheld the richness of the
plains. There were endless miles of wheat and
maize and linseed; there were the great herds of
cattle and sheep. I witnessed the sugar cane harvest
in the north in full swing.</p>

<p>All the goods are not brought into "B.A." The
line runs to three up-river ports, Rosario, Villa
Constitucion and Campana, where there are wide
wharves and grain elevators. A goods tonnage of
nearly 7,000,000 a year and receipts of nearly
£3,500,000 a year spell big business. Yet one found
this was only the beginning of things. Already
there are gigantic schemes in project for irrigation
works in those stretches which are incapable of use
because of the insufficient rainfall. The Argentine
Government is giving serious attention to this matter.
But the railway companies in the Republic are not
content to twiddle their thumbs and keep asking,
"Why does not the Government do something?"
All of them are attending to irrigation themselves,
or are doing the work for the Government. The
Central Argentine, on behalf of the Government,
have an irrigation scheme on hand which will cost
close upon £600,000. New lines and extensions up
to a further 1,600 miles are projected to cost
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
£8,000,000. Over 35,000 employees are on this
line. The length of rolling stock is 143 miles, including
600 passenger coaches and 2,200 beds.
Twenty million passengers are carried a year, and
the total receipts work out at £40 a week per mile.</p>

<p>The second big railway which attracted my
admiration was the Buenos Aires and Pacific, which
strikes westward across the continent. The company
was formed as recently as 1882, but it has a
present capital of over £50,500,000. It owns 1,406
miles, it leases 2,011 miles, and so operates 3,417
miles. Some 150 miles are under construction. It
has over 16,000,000 passengers annually, and over
6,000,000 tons of freight; and its gross earnings
in the last financial year (July 1912 to June 1913)
were £5,590,613. During the last ten years it has
absorbed a number of lesser lines&mdash;the Villa Maria
Rufino, the Bahia Blanca and North-Western, the
Great Western, and, lastly, the Argentine Transandine.
It has also bought a length of over 200 miles
of Government line out in the west. The "B.A.
and Pacific" has several subsidiary undertakings.
In conjunction with the Great Southern Railway
it has a well-equipped light and power company.
In my chapter on Bahia Blanca I shall deal with the
port accommodation provided by the Pacific Company
to dispatch the grain produced within its area
to Europe. Perhaps the most important improvement
made by the company has been the high level
independent access to the city of Buenos Aires.
This line, which is five miles in length, consists of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
two viaducts of brickwork, containing 116 arches of
42.3 feet span each, and 19 steel bridges, the largest
being 178.8 feet. From the River Plate an area of
366 acres is being reclaimed to be used for goods
sidings and access to the docks. For the conveyance
of coal, and materials for use on the line, the
company owns its own fleet of steamers. It would
be easy enough to give a bunch of figures to show
how the passenger traffic has grown; anyway, its
suburban service bears comparison with that of
any other line entering the capital.</p>

<p>The Buenos Aires and Pacific Railway is becoming
increasingly popular, for people desiring to see
the world now travel from "B.A." across the pampas,
over the Andes, and so down to Valparaiso in Chili,
where steamers can be obtained to take them up
to Peru, Panama, and San Francisco. Leaving
"B.A.," the train runs for some twelve hours across
an extensive plain which is far from indicating to
the traveller the great mountain ranges which will
surprise him later on. Across this plain the lines of
the railway extend in an absolutely straight line
from Vedia to Makenna, a distance of 175 miles,
which is the world's record. Near the first-mentioned
station the railway curves in the form of an S;
without this, the stretch on the straight would have
been 206 miles long.</p>

<p>Although the pampas are occasionally marked by
undulations and small green-covered slopes, the
first notable elevations are not encountered until
Mercedes is reached. These are the San Luis hills,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
the outposts of the Cordillera. Passing on the
western side of this chain the picturesque city of
San Luis is reached. As the traveller approaches
the Cordillera of the Andes he finds himself in a
district topographically distinct but always fertile,
and watered by canals fed by the Tunuyan and
Mendoza rivers. The view of the Cordillera in the
early morning is a spectacle worthy of admiration.
At a distance of one hundred miles before arrival at
Mendoza the interminable chain of the Andes, with
its snow-capped peaks mingling with the clouds,
is distinguishable. As the train approaches their
imposing grandeur becomes more and more evident.
Another of the views which delights the tourist, and
makes the business man think, is that of the

line in a delightful prospect until lost on the horizon.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>From Mendoza the line runs across the Andes by
the Uspallata Valley route, the only transcontinental
line in South America. What the Suez Canal and
the Trans-Siberian Railway have done for the Far
Eastern trade, the Transandine Railway is achieving
for transcontinental traffic in South America by
giving rapid communication between the two South
American Republics&mdash;reducing the journey between
Buenos Aires and Valparaiso from thirteen and a
half days to thirty-eight hours&mdash;and thereby cementing
closer commercial relations and developing trade
with the Far East.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>This has only been made possible by the summit
tunnel of the Transandine Railway, which was opened
for public traffic in May, 1910, so that the distance
between Buenos Aires and Valparaiso has been
reduced to 888 miles. It is probably of interest to
state that this tunnel is one of the longest of its kind
in the world, being 10,384 feet long, including two
artificial ends 442 feet in length altogether, and it
lies at an elevation of 10,778 feet above the sea-level.
It is nearly 1,500 feet higher than the highest
carriage road in Europe, that over the Stelvio Pass,
and more than 3,500 feet higher than the Mont
Cenis, St. Gothard, and Simplon tunnels. So well
were the levels and lines kept that the difference at
the junction was only &frac34; inch, and of the line 2&frac34; inches,
while the chainage was only 2.14 inches less than
calculated. At one period 1,700 men were engaged
on the works.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the beautiful and impressive bronze
statue of the Christ is not visible to passengers in the
train, but it can easily be reached by coach or
mule from Inca. It stands some 3,000 feet higher
than Las Cuevas, and is situated on the dividing
line between Argentina and Chili. It was the
gift of a pious Buenos Aires lady, Señora César
de Costa, and was erected as a monument to the
signing of the peace treaty between the two
countries.</p>

<p>The Pacific Railway has expended over £80,000
in snow protection for their line during the past
two years, with the result that through traffic can
be maintained throughout the severest winter with
perfect safety.</p>

<p>The line brings Chili at least a fortnight nearer
London, a great consideration in these days of commercial
enterprise. British manufacturers are taking
advantage of the fact, and that there is a growing
demand in Chili for British goods is shown by the
increasing number of representatives who favour
this route. Previous to the opening of the railway
passengers and goods had to travel by boat through
the treacherous Straits of Magellan, a long and
tedious journey. Now a well-appointed and comfortable
train is entered at Buenos Aires, and thirty-eight
hours later the traveller finds himself in Valparaiso
or Santiago.</p>

<p>But the fortune of the Buenos Aires and Pacific
Railway really lies in the V-shaped territory from
Mendoza to Bahia Blanca and Buenos Aires. There
is a great country still to be awakened in the foothills
of the Andes. There are millions of acres on
the pampas awaiting the plough and the coming of
the cattle breeder. The Pacific Company cannot
but go on and prosper. It is a matter of regret,
however, that it has lost as general manager Mr.
Guy Calthrop. In the handling of a complex railway
system he has no superior. A strong man,
physically and mentally, he has had rough hours
during labour trouble. But he kept a steady nerve.
He went out to Argentina with high reputation of
his work on the Caledonian line; he has shown
the capacity of a general in the development of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
traffic during the few years he has been in Argentina.
But England called him to take the most
responsible post in the railway world, the general
managership of the London and North Western
Company.</p>

<p>Now I come to the Great Southern Company, one
of the oldest and one of the most famous lines on the
South American continent. From "B.A." it extends
southwards for 500 miles to Bahia Blanca. From
there it shoots westwards for 348 miles to Neuquén,
and an extension to the Chilian frontier is on its
way. On behalf of the Government the company
is carrying forward extensive irrigation works in
the Neuquén territory which, when completed, will
convert the valleys of the upper Rio Negro and
Rio Neuquén, hitherto one of the least productive,
into one of the most fertile regions of the country.
The growth of the company, since it started in
1865 with a length of 71 miles, is worth noting.
After 1865 the mileage grew progressively as follows:
1873, 145 miles; 1883, 472 miles; 1893, 1,406
miles; 1903, 2,404 miles; 1913, 3,641 miles. The
lines actually in course of construction, or about
to be commenced, represent some 670 miles. Thus
it can be safely calculated that the mileage of the
Great Southern Railway will, before long, exceed
4,300 miles. You get an appreciation of the zone
served by the Southern by the comparative figures
of the increase in its passenger traffic during the
last five years: 1909, 16,865,200; 1910, 18,906,505;
1911, 22,231,112; 1912, 24,069,974; 1913, 27,454,719.
Of these last figures, for 1913, it is significant that the
suburban traffic is represented by 19,841,156, which
shows the population that lives within reach of
Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>Passenger traffic is, in fact, a main feature of the
Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway. On the
Monday following the Easter holidays in 1913 trains
with no fewer than 102 sleeping coaches arrived at
the company's termini in Buenos Aires. Of these,
fifty were from the fashionable bathing resort at
Mar del Plata. The special feature of this Mar del
Plata service is, that during the season as many as
three heavy trains, composed of sleeping cars, are
run nightly, in addition to afternoon expresses,
formed of luxurious parlour cars, which run three
days a week. In 1913 35,964 return tickets were
sold to this watering place 250 miles from Buenos
Aires. In the same year parcels and excess baggage
represented 291,608 tons, though it should be stated
more than half this amount was for milk, butter,
and cream. The number of tons of goods carried
in 1909 was 4,852,379; in 1913 the tonnage was
7,977,663. Live stock carried in 1909 were 5,576,983,
whilst in 1913 the number was 6,562,951. Fully
50 per cent. of the live stock received at the slaughter-houses
for consumption in Buenos Aires, and by
the freezing establishments for export to England
in the form of frozen or chilled meat, is dispatched
from southern stations. The bull that obtained
the championship in 1913 at Palermo, and fetched
the world-record price of £7,000, was born on Señor
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
Pereyra Iraola's estate at Pereyra station on the
Great Southern Railway.</p>

<p>Practically the whole of the zone served by the
Great Southern Railway in the Province of Buenos
Aires is adaptable to the growing of cereals generally,
with the exception of maize, which is limited
to the districts nearest Buenos Aires. The authorised
capital of the Southern is £53,525,530, and
that issued amounts to £48,981,530. The net receipts
for 1913 (June 30th) amounted to £2,870,349, and
the dividend for the year was 7 per cent., which
has been maintained for the last fifteen years, being,
indeed, as high as the law will permit. The company's
rolling stock, comprising some 15,000 vehicles,
was recently valued at £7,437,654. The general
manager of the company is Mr. Percy Clarke, the
doyen amongst English railway officials in Argentina,
and a man of charming personality.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary for me to go through a catalogue
of all that is being done by the various railroads
in the Republic. But I must refer to the
work being done by what is known as the "Farquhar
group," an amalgamation of railways under
the spirited enterprise of Mr. Percival Farquhar, a
go-ahead North American who is chiefly responsible
for the creation of the Argentine Railway Company,
which is incorporated under the laws of the
State of Maine, U.S.A. This company was formed a
couple of years ago (July 12th, 1912) to group together
various railways in order to obtain benefits of unified
management, and provide increased railroad facilities
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
in the northern districts of the Republic. Two of
the principal railways which this company now control
are the Central Cordoba and the Entre Rios
lines. Also it has a controlling interest in a number
of smaller companies. The biggest amalgamation
effected by this company has been the purchase by
the Cordoba Central Railway of the undertakings of
the Cordoba and Rosario and Cordoba Central
Buenos Aires Extension Lines; and the proposal at
the time of writing is to create £23,000,000 worth of
new stock, whilst £18,000,000 worth is to be issued
to the holders of existing stock in the three companies.
A good deal of reorganisation is in progress.</p>

<p>Although competition between the big lines is
as severe as anywhere in the world, except within the
United States, this movement in Argentina for
amalgamation and agreement in regard to spheres
of interest shows a disposition to put an end to
fierce rivalry. Indeed, it is more than likely that
within the next few years there will be more amalgamation
and working agreements between the big
companies.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

<h3>ROSARIO</h3>


<p>It was not my fortune to see Rosario, one of the
leading commercial cities in the Republic, under the
most favourable circumstances. During the few
days I was there the weather was all it ought not
to have been&mdash;dull and rainy and cold&mdash;and the
streets, except in a few central thoroughfares, morasses
of mire.</p>

<p>It is a purely commercial town. It puts forward
no claim to be artistic or cultured, and it has no
pretensions to be a leader of fashion. All the men
in Rosario are engaged in money-making. There are
big offices, and the business men are at their desks
early in the morning and remain late in the afternoon.
Great railway lines converge upon Rosario,
and along the front of the River Parana there are
miles of goods sheds and wharves, with ships lying
alongside into which the elevators pour their streams
of wheat. There is the constant shunting of trains,
the shrieking of cranes, and the swinging of derricks.</p>

<p>The workers are the best type of Latins, Italians
from North Italy, or North Catalonian Spaniards or
Basques. Other Latins do not get much of a chance
in Rosario. There are a number of Englishmen,
but they are swamped in the total. I made inquiries
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
about the relative merits of English and Italian
working men, and was told that the Englishmen are
superior, two of them doing the work which it generally
takes three Italians to accomplish. But it did
not strike me, considering the high cost of living,
that the workers in Rosario are highly paid from an
English point of view. Commerce is frequently
held up by strikes. Indeed, there is probably no
place where strikes are so recurrent as in Rosario.</p>

<p>This is a town which came into existence a century
ago as a sort of military outpost to fight the
Indians. Half a century back it was little more than
a village, and in 1870 it had a population of 21,000.
To-day the inhabitants number 200,000. It is a
great port for sending abroad wheat, maize, and
linseed; indeed, its exports annually are about
5,000,000 tons. As the country north of Rosario
is rapidly being colonised, and as the town is
the up-river port capable of receiving ocean-going
steamers, its continued growth is assured. Though,
of course, I do not forget the gradual silting of
the River Plate into which the Parana flows, and the
restraint this is sure to put upon shipping in the
future, Rosario is certain to go ahead. The day is
not far distant when there will be extended railway
communication between Argentina, Brazil, and
Bolivia; and, as all the lines will pass through
Rosario, it will get the benefit. It is reported that
Brazil has coal mines yet to be exploited, and if
this takes place Argentina, which is much in need
of coal, will be one of the principal markets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>I spent an interesting morning in the workshops
of the Central Argentine Railway, which are situated
here. They are extensive works, though most of
the engines on the line are brought from England.
The majority of the workmen, naturally enough,
are Italians, though the men at the heads of departments
are Englishmen. The goods yard of the
Central Argentine Company is as large as that at
Crewe, and is ever busy with the great freight cars
coming in from the west and north. When I was
there the railway station was being transferred to
another part of the city so that passenger and goods
traffic could be more expeditiously handled.</p>

<p>Though Rosario prides itself that it keeps its nose
to the grindstone in the matter of money-making,
it is not quite neglectful of other sides of life. There
is a fine system of electric tramways. There are
huge blocks of municipal buildings, and imposing
banks and theatres; but the law courts, whilst
having a fine exterior, suggested a certain shabbiness
to me because of the weeds that were growing
in the courtyards. There is the usual race-course,
and close by there is the Parque Independencia. And,
of course, there is a Plaza San Martin, whilst in other
parts of the town is the Plaza San Lopez, and the
Plaza Jewell, presented by an Englishman who made
his fortune in the city. Some distance outside
Rosario is the English suburb of Fisherton, and I
noticed that the Englishmen had fallen into the
Argentine practice of calling their houses after their
wives&mdash;the Villa Elsie, the Villa Florence, the Villa
Ethel, and so on. As might be expected, there is
a golf course. In the city itself there is a Strangers'
Club, of which most of the members are Englishmen.</p>

<p>An evidence of the prosperity of Rosario is the
way in which land has increased in value. Plots
which in 1885 could have been bought for 2s. 6d.
a yard now fetch £200 a yard. On the outskirts
of the town, where a few years back a bit of land
on which to build a residence&mdash;say twenty yards by
sixty yards&mdash;could have been obtained for £5, it
cannot be obtained to-day for less than £150. I
saw one stretch on the river front which was bought
twenty years ago for £2,000 and sold last year for
£40,000. Twenty miles from Rosario camp land
which a dozen years ago could have been obtained
for £10,000 the square league is not allowed to change
hands to-day for less than £100,000 the square league.</p>

<p>With nightfall the Rosario people give themselves
up to pleasure. Attached to the big hotel there is a
huge saloon, and whilst men play dominoes and
cards, music is provided by a band composed of
Austrian girls. There is a great <i>café chantant</i>, and
every night hundreds of people, men and their wives,
sit at the little tables having meals, or partaking of
beverages, whilst a band plays and comic singers
perform, or a kinematograph entertainment is provided.
I saw nothing at all in Rosario to suggest
it was a place of culture. But it is a town throbbing
with commercial activity, and when business is over
the people seek nothing more than the lightest of
entertainment.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

<h3>CORDOBA AND ITS ATTRACTIONS</h3>


<p>An old-time languorous atmosphere seems to hang
round Cordoba. It is a city with eighty churches,
and as it has a population of 80,000, I pride myself
on my arithmetic that works it out to one church for
every thousand inhabitants. It is named after
Cordova, in Spain, was founded in 1504, and is
the Oxford of the Argentine. Its university dates
from 1666, and has a high reputation for learning
in law and medicine.</p>

<p>Those old Spaniards who came pioneering down
this way from Peru in their early days of conquest
had a neat eye for the picturesque. Speaking generally,
I would not place Argentina high as a land of
beauty. But in the middle land there is a fine rib
of mountains, the Sierra de Cordoba; and on a rise,
so that it may be seen from afar, when the heat
dances hazily there is something immaterial about
Cordoba as though it were the city of a waking
dream. See it, however, in the early morning, when
the air is fresh and the gleam of the sun catches
it sideways and the buildings are silhouetted
against shadows, and you witness a picture which
would enthral an artist.</p>

<p>By northern European standard it is not an
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
ancient city. But as living beneath the sun brings
early old age to men and women, so cities which
have had a few centuries of constant sun glare get
a drowsy mediævalism which sister cities in more
temperate climes must have long ages to acquire.
The aroma of the Church and of scholasticism permeates
Cordoba. In many respects it is quite
modern, with its big new hotel, where the band
plays in the restaurant whilst you are dining, and
its streets lit with electricity and electric tramcars
jangling their way through the squares and plenty
of taxi-cabs on the ranks.</p>

<p>But the tendency is to forget these, and in recollection
of the place you think chiefly of the quiet
in the quadrangle of the university, the calm of the
great library, the weatherworn walls of the old
churches and the dim lights of their interiors doing
much to soften the tawdriness of the decorations.
There is a good deal in the assertion occasionally
made that the towns of recently developed countries
lack individuality, distinction; that, with all their
progress, they are more or less duplicates of each
other. It is easy enough in Argentina to find evidence
of this modern spirit in town planning. Yet
I know of none of the newer countries where the towns
have such a separate character as in Argentina.</p>

<p>Of course, there are raw townships of yesterday
which have nothing to show but two wretched rows
of badly built houses on each side of the railway
track, just as you will find in the western parts of
the United States and Canada. As Argentine towns
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
grow they do not grow uniformly, as though they
were designed by the same architect or were imitating
one another. They show individuality. If you like,
it may be just a desire to show off. Many municipalities
are loaded with debt. But they will have
their cities beautiful. When they have made a
broad grass-plotted, tree-girt avenue right through
the town to the railway station, and the station
buildings are low and ugly and out of keeping with
the rest of the town, and the railway authorities
at Buenos Aires turn a deaf ear to the deputations
which may wait upon them, you can safely bet that
one of these nights the railway buildings will be
consumed by fire, so that the company is compelled
to erect a new station.</p>

<p>Because it is the oldest city in Argentina and
has inhabitants with pedigrees, and because of the
society attracted to it, Cordoba regards itself as
the aristocratic centre of the Republic. In the
neighbouring hills are sanatoria, like Jesu Maria,
much favoured by the people of the plains who
need a change.</p>

<p>Cordoba, like other places, is quite certain it has
the best-dressed ladies. In a sedate sort of way
there is a good deal of gaiety. On hot summer evenings
a band plays in the square, where there is a statue
of San Martin. There may be a town in Argentina
which has not an equestrian statue of the Liberator
from Spain. If so, I must have missed it. The
statues are all facsimiles of the original, and there
must be dozens of them. It is the one point on which
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
all the towns agree; they must have a statue of San
Martin on a prancing steed, and eternally pointing
in the direction of the Andes. Once I unfortunately
made an Argentine angry, for, being anxious to
show me the beauties of his town, he sought my
wishes as to what I desired to see, and I replied,
"Anything you like, so long as you do not take me
to see the statue of San Martin&mdash;I've seen him so
often during the last month." The feathers were
up at once. I smoothed them down by assuring
him that we have very few statues of Wellington
in England.</p>

<p>The Cordobians are fond of music and racing and
gambling, and sitting in the cafés throwing the dice-box.
There is a delightful theatre, the Rivera
Indarte, built by the provincial Government. Opera
companies which go to Buenos Aires are invited to
come to Cordoba, and the authorities give a guarantee
against loss. The proper thing is to buy a
box, holding six persons, for the little season of
ten performances. The cost of such a box is £150.
The charge is a dollar for the <i>entrada</i> (entrance),
which provides nothing except permission to enter
the building. This <i>entrada</i> charge is like the charge
for "attendance" in old-fashioned hotels in England,
which is an excuse for sticking another eighteenpence
a day on your bill so that you may be deceived
into thinking you are paying six shillings for your
room when you are really paying seven and sixpence.
So at the opera in Cordoba, usually Italian, the lowest
ticket is two dollars to be permitted to stand up,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
but you have already parted with one dollar to go
in. Cordoba province, like the other provinces,
thinks no small beer of itself. It rather resents
receiving orders from the Federal Government sitting
in Buenos Aires. Perhaps that is the reason
the Argentine National Anthem is so seldom heard.</p>

<p>Students are attracted to Cordoba University
from all over the country. Most of the professors
have had experience of European universities, generally
French. The library is extensive and varied.
I handled some fine old Bibles, bound in sheepskin,
relics of the early Spaniards. Also there is a remarkable
collection of old maps, showing that the priests
as they travelled this way were first-class geographers.
Whatever literary sentiment there is in Argentina
finds expression in Cordoba. Indeed, it is the natural
meeting-place for men inclined to culture for its
own sake. But it is by no means a sleepy hollow.
It has several really good newspapers. There is a
great export of lime. Being the centre of a big
wheat area, much milling is done by modern electric
appliance. Light and power are provided by an
enterprising English company. There is a shoe
factory, which turns out 2,500 pairs of footwear
a day.</p>

<p>Yet, as I have said, though there is plenty to
prove that Cordoba is awake, the impression left
on the memory is that it is an old-fashioned Spanish
university town that has strayed to the central part
of South America. This may be because I spent
most of my time in the university buildings, or
roaming through the churches. In the cathedral a
shrivelled but kindly old priest showed me a gallery
of bishops of Cordoba; but I suspect they are much
like the Scottish kings which adorn the walls of
Holyrood Palace, many painted by one hand, and
from imagination of what the bishops looked like
rather than from any knowledge of their actual
appearance.</p>

<p>I went to the Jesuit church, where a tonsured,
jolly monk showed me the relics. People who had
had rheumatism, and who had been cured by prayer,
gave acknowledgment by sending golden arms or
silver legs. There was a little golden motor car,
and this came from a lady who in a terrible smash
prayed her life might be saved; and it was saved,
and here was her gift. Here was the statue of the
Virgin, which performs miracles. Those who are
inclined to doubt are shown a stack of crutches of
those who hobbled into the church to seek the aid
of the Virgin and walked out quite cured. The
little figure of the Virgin is as fresh as though it
had been carved and painted only last year. Yet
the story goes it has never been touched for nigh
four hundred years. In those far-off days it was
sent from Spain. But the ship was wrecked in mid-Atlantic.
Those who had expected the statue were
in distress, and prayers were offered on the coast
that the good Mother would send another statue.
And whilst they prayed the case in which was the statue
was floated on the shore, and the statue was quite
unharmed. At once miracles were performed, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
miracles have been performed over since. I saw
the crutches and I saw the golden motor-car.</p>

<p>From the rafters hung many flags of foreign
countries captured by Argentina in war. There is
a Union Jack, with colours dimmed with years,
which was seized from the British nearly a hundred
years ago, when a British force landed and it was a
toss-up whether Argentina would not become a
British Colony. Many British visitors cast a regretful
eye upon that drooping flag in the Jesuit
church at Cordoba. They are not told&mdash;but it is
a fact all the same&mdash;it is not the real flag. I was
shown the real flag folded in a glass case in a room
behind the altar. Some years ago a number of young
Englishmen travelling in the country recovered the
real flag, which then hung in the chancel. There
was such a how-d'ye-do that it had to be returned.
To avoid a similar mishap it was put under lock
and key in a glass case, and kept in a chamber not
accessible to the public. But the public would still
want to see the British flag. So not to disappoint
them an exact copy was made, and it is the imitation
flag upon which most visiting Englishmen cast
a patriotic but regretful eye.</p>

<p>There is an agricultural college, a wonderful drive
up a hill to a park which provides long distance
views, an English school and a German school.
I could easily give a dozen places where these
developments can be found, and better. The point
is that you find these things at all in the very heart
of South America. Being the heart of the southern
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
continent, Cordoba has been selected by the Government
as its chief observatory. It is the Argentine
Greenwich. The Republic keeps the same time from
east to west, and it keeps Cordoba time. The
observatory is under the control of a staff from the
United States.</p>

<p>The Cordobians are great lovers of pleasure.
Sometimes on the grim hoardings of London you
see how a railway company will take you, first class,
to a popular seaside resort, house and feed you in
a well-known hotel, and bring you back at a fixed
inclusive sum for the week-end. The Central Argentine
Railway does the same thing in regard to Alta
Gracia, a pleasant village in the hills, and where
there is the best mountain hotel in the world. Alta
Gracia is about an hour's run from Cordoba, and
on Sundays there is a rush of holiday-makers, reminiscent
of the Pullman express out of London down
to Brighton on a Sunday morning. The "fixed
charge" is popular. Everybody knows exactly how
much the outing is going to cost. At ten o'clock a
train thronged with holiday-makers sets out for
Alta Gracia. By eleven o'clock the place is reached.
At noon there is <i>déjeuner</i>. The afternoon can be
spent lounging about, listening to the band, playing
golf, playing tennis, gambling in the casino, taking
walks in the wooded hills. At seven o'clock is
dinner. The train returns at nine o'clock, and by
ten Cordoba and home is reached.</p>

<p>One of the pleasantest week-ends in my life I
spent at Alta Gracia. There is a little group of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Englishmen, associated with the Central Argentine
Railway, living at Cordoba, and, as officials have
special cars, we had a couple of cars attached to the
train on Saturday night. At Alta Gracia these were
detached and side tracked. Then we "roughed it"
for twenty-four hours. After the cocktails, and
whilst dinner was being prepared, we sat out on the
plain. On one side rose the village, revealed by
points of light in the blackness, and on the summit
of the hill was a glow of light just like a great and
well-illumined liner appears as she ploughs the sea.
That was the mountain hotel. On the other side
was the prairie, just a streak of dark below the
deep blue of the sky. The stars seemed bigger and
nearer and more numerous than they do in northern
climes. There was the usual searching for the
Southern Cross, and when found we all agreed it
was the most overrated constellation in the heavens.
A caressing warmth was in the air. It was good
to sit there, smoking our pipes and "listening to
the silence."</p>

<p>Away on the plains of central South America&mdash;that
sounds like "roughing it." But you have
got to go much farther afield to rough it. The
car which my friend and I had would have attracted
much notice in England. There was a pleasant
sitting-room, with big easy chairs and a real English
open fireplace. There were three bedrooms, not
the "cribb'd, cabin'd, confin'd" cabins we have
in our "sleepers" at home, and there was the luxury
of a bathroom. There was a kitchen, a chef, and
a sprightly waiter. The whole car was lit by electricity.
So we sat down to dinner&mdash;half a dozen
courses as excellent as can be served at a London
restaurant which looks after its reputation. We
filled the coach with our tobacco smoke; we told
our best stories; we exchanged yarns about things
which had befallen us in distant parts of the world&mdash;in
Siberia and Australia, Peru and Havana, the
Soudan and California&mdash;for here the corners of the
earth were met in a side-tracked private car in the
lee of a pretty holiday village in the middle of
Argentina. The Spaniards have done much to this
land; but bands of young Englishmen have played
and are playing their part.</p>

<p>In the delicious freshness of the dawn we sauntered
about in our pyjamas, drank tea and smoked
cigarettes. The day came with a rush of glory.
It was Sunday morning, and the bell in the monastic
church on the hill was clanging for the faithful to
go and pray. The mystery which hung over Alta
Gracia had gone, and in the truthful light of the
morning it was just a straggling Spanish village,
with many trees about, and the red hills in the
distance making a jagged background. It was a
torrid Sunday morning, and when we had had our
tubs, and had shaven and put on our flannels, we
set out to "make a day of it."</p>

<p>The bell of the old church was clang-clanging.
Peasants in their Sunday clothes&mdash;the women squat
and short-skirted and with highly coloured kerchiefs
over their heads, the men in baggy velvet trousers
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
and slouch hats, their faces polished with soap and
their hair reeking with scented oil&mdash;were slowly
climbing to worship. The walls of the church, and
the buildings where the monks formerly lived, suggested
a fortress prepared to resist attack rather
than a haven of peace. There were long slits in the
stonework through which the nose of a musket
could be stuck. For in the old days the monks
had to fight as well as pray. Alta Gracia was very
lonely centuries ago, and always liable to attack.
But now all that is far in the background. The church
was crowded. The priest at the candled altar was
chanting. The air was pungent with incense. There
was not room for all the worshippers to sit so
many stood, and when they knelt they spread their
handkerchiefs on the floor. There was nothing
which could be described as distinctively Argentine.
Better-to-do folk were dressed just like better-to-do
folk are dressed in Europe. It was just
the usual Sunday morning scene you can witness
in Spain and Italy&mdash;countries six thousand miles
away.</p>

<p>One blinked on coming from the shadows of the
church into the sunshine. The holiday-makers from
Cordoba had arrived, and were scattering to find
suitable haunts for picnicking. We tramped up the
heavy, dusty road, panting and perspiring, but
encouraged by the sight of the spreading, low-roofed
hotel. Ah! at last we were on the broad balcony,
twice as wide as the promenade deck of our greatest
liner. A touch of the bell, and we were having our
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
favourite beverages, much iced. Through the shimmering
heat the eye could wander over the endless
brown plains. Solemn Argentines, inclined to portliness,
sat in big basket-chairs, surrounded by their
sedate families, doing nothing at all. There were
invalids who had come here for the high, dry air.
There were noisy English youths, in gorgeous blazers,
arranging a tennis match. A party of heavy-shoed
golfers were setting out.</p>

<p>Alta Gracia is renowned throughout Argentina
as a health resort. In the hot months&mdash;and it can
be very hot around January&mdash;many families come
here, for there is always a refreshing breeze. There
are hundreds of rooms in the hotel. Bathrooms are
innumerable. There are suites and single chambers.
The furniture is tasteful but not luxurious. The
dining-room is in white. There is a ball-room.
There is a resident orchestra. I know most of the
big hotels in the mountains of Switzerland, but no
one is comparable in conveniences to this.</p>

<p>Across the gardens, a hundred yards away, is
the casino, quite apart from the hotel, but provided
for those who want to gamble&mdash;and where is the
Argentine who does not like to gamble? There are
large public rooms; there are small rooms, decorated
in a variety of styles, for private gaming parties;
there is a refreshment and reading-room, German in
appearance; there is a beautiful little theatre. No,
I am receiving no fee to advertise Alta Gracia. With
the exception of my companion, I am quite sure there
was not a soul in the place who knew what my name
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
was, or bothered their heads what was the business
of a tourist-looking fellow like myself.</p>

<p>We lunched, we had our coffee, and then we
hired one of the hotel motor-cars and went for a forty
or fifty mile spin. Roads&mdash;there were no roads.
There were passable tracks and a considerable amount
of bouncing which tested the springs of the car.
Like all Latin chauffeurs the driver had a mania
for speed. The way serpentined amongst the rocks
and through scraggy woods, so we had often to make
a sudden duck to avoid getting whipped in the face
by a branch. We banged and swerved, but even the
awful threat of not giving the driver a tip did not
hold him in for more than a hundred yards at a
stretch from letting that car tear along at its
maddest. He took us to see a gurgling little river,
the Bolsa, tripping through a sylvan glade which
caused me to exclaim, "Why, it is just like a bit of
Dovedale!"</p>

<p>Off again at a furious pace, heaving, diving,
skirting hills. "If there is a smash you will be the
first killed." But the chauffeur only laughed over
his shoulder. We struck up a defile, and the hills
rose high on either side. Mountain ponies scampered
about; goats hailed us from rocky heights.
Gauchos, swarthy and handsome, with their women
perched behind, were overtaken on stallions
which were restive and inclined to bolt at the
approach of the automobile. A bend in the narrow
way, and we nearly ran into a funeral procession;
the coffin on a cart and covered with a dingy pall,
and the friends of the dead man in many and varied
vehicles following, in no garb of mourning, but non-chalantly
smoking cigarettes. There was backing of
the car till it could be run on a piece of grass. The
horses hauling the dead man laid their ears well
forward and then well back, but were led past the
thing they were afraid of without accident. We
exchanged the greetings of the day with the friends
of the dead man. He was going to be buried twelve
miles away, and it would be well into the night before
they got back. The motor-car snorted and jumped
on its way. It was a beautiful afternoon.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1715" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>

<p>The chauffeur brought us to a chalet which we
reached by crossing a brook and passing through
a garden. It was a house of refreshment. And what
kind of refreshment in an out-of-the-way part of
the world? A sad-faced girl gave us a curtsy and
waited our orders whilst we stretched our legs beneath
an orange tree. Now what had she to offer
in the way of refreshment? The señors could
have what they wished. I inquired about champagne.
Certainly! But who on earth could want
champagne on the edge of the world out there?
We did not have champagne. We had a bottle of
native white wine and aerated water. The chauffeur!
Oh, his fancy ran to a bottle of beer; indeed,
he had two bottles of beer. And who was the dead
man we had passed? we asked the maid. Her
brother. Last night he took ill and ere morning he
was dead, and now they had taken him away. An
old man came to the door and looked up the sunlit
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
valley. The little two-year-old son of the dead
man had a stick, and was chasing some ducks toward
the brook; he was radiantly happy. We
commiserated with the old man. He thanked the
señors and hoped the wine was as we wished. He
did not know why his son died; the sweet Mother
in Heaven knew; anyway, he had gone; could he
get the señor another chair, for that he was sitting
on could not be comfortable?</p>

<p>Back to Alta Gracia. Some of our friends had
been playing golf, and we must go to the club-house.
A well-laid-out nine-hole course, but the "greens"
are of caked mud; they cannot grow grass out
here as we can at home. There is the usual golfers'
talk; there was "rotten luck being bunkered just
in front of the fourth hole"; "That was a lovely
drive from the eighth"; "Hang it all, he was quite
off colour with his brassie, and he generally fancied
himself with his brassie work"; "Well, of all the
fortunate foozlers, a chap like that doing the fifth
in three"&mdash;and so on. It was just like dear old
England.</p>

<p>Somebody remarked there were gaucho races
over on the other side of the town. Gaucho races&mdash;races
amongst the men of the soil, the native cowboys
of the Argentine prairies! Tune up that
motor-car. I can see lots of golf in other parts of
the world, but here was one of the things I had
dreamed about coming out to see&mdash;a gaucho race-meeting.</p>

<p>No, I have no need to think out admiring adjectives
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
to describe that course. It was only a bit of
a course. The posts were ramshackle, and the wire
which had connected them was broken and trailed
on the ground, or had gone altogether. There was
what I took to be intended for a grand stand, a
wheezy erection of unpainted wood, but there was
nobody on it.</p>

<p>There were hundreds of gauchos, the real article,
with skins like leather, eyes as black as night, and
most of them were on ponies and astride Spanish
saddles, and they were picturesquely garbed, but
not so picturesquely as you see them in coloured
illustrations. They were noisy, and prancing their
horses about and challenging each other. They had
ridden in fifteen and twenty miles, some of them,
and their women had driven in the carts with provisions
for the day. The women had little encampments
in the bushes, and fires burning, and they
made coffee and served their lords with chunks of
food.</p>

<p>The men are all laughing and arguing the merits
of their ponies. Nearly everybody is mounted. One
gaucho is jumping from group to group, waving two
paper pesos (about 3s. 4d.) and demanding who
will lay two pesos against his pony. The jabber is
interminable. He gets taken. Excitement runs
through the crowd. The competitors each hand
the money to an old fellow who stands on a rickety
platform which serves as judges' box. Then they
amble off toward a tree where they are their own
starters. A native policeman frantically yells for
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
the course to be cleared. Some sort of passage-way
is made, and then there is the customary confounded
dog which will not get out of the way.</p>

<p>Here they come, and in a pelt of dust. They ride
well and with a loose rein. The riders swing their
arms and yell as though they would frighten their
steeds to greater efforts. You can feel the quiver
in the crowd. By go the horses, running neck to
neck. But one has won by a nose. The winner
trots up smiling, and he gets the four pesos held
by the judge.</p>

<p>But the clamour has begun again. One man,
rather a gaudy buck and with a fine horse, challenges
the world. He will race any man for five pesos, and
he has the money in his hand to show he means
business. Well, he will lay his five pesos to anybody
else's four. Everybody is talking about his
own horse, or somebody else's horse, or egging two
enthusiasts to cease their talking and have the thing
settled by a race.</p>

<p>These gauchos belong to a long line of men who
have lived on their prairies and had to do with
horses ever since the Spaniards first landed. They
go to horse-races not for a pleasant holiday, but
because the fever of horse-racing is in their veins.</p>

<p>And that night after dinner we sat in the
great light of the veranda, and the mighty purple
night was beyond, and the air was heavy with the
musk which rises from the plains after a hot day
and the great locusts which swerved toward us!
Some women gave little screams in fear they might
get amongst their hair. Men who knew their harmlessness&mdash;except
when there was a crop of young
wheat to be devoured&mdash;caught them in their hands.</p>

<p>We tramped through the dimly lit village and
heard the songs of Spain and Italy streaming from
the cafés. We saw the crowd of merry-makers
packing into the train to return to Cordoba. And
when the train, a streak of light, had snorted into
the blackness till in the distance it appeared like a
crawling glowworm, we got chairs from out of the
private car and sat beneath the stars and smoked
our pipes, and wondered what was happening in
England. At first there was warmth in the air.
But the chill of midnight had come, and the grasshoppers
had ceased their song, before we climbed
to bed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

<h3>BAHIA BLANCA AND THE COUNTRY BEYOND</h3>


<p>If I were suddenly asked to name the town which
has most rapidly sprung ahead during the last few
years, Bahia Blanca would at once jump to my lips.</p>

<p>It is 350 miles south of the River Plate, and if
you searched the coast line for six hundred miles
below Buenos Aires it is only here you would find
a natural harbour capable of receiving the largest
of steamers. With the gradual silting of the River
Plate, which, notwithstanding constant dredging,
will be a constant handicap to the shipping of the
capital and Rosario, Bahia Blanca, with advantages
which neither of the other two towns possesses,
will undoubtedly become the real Liverpool
of Argentina.</p>

<p>In 1880 the place had a population of less than
2,000. To-day its population is 70,000, and it is
increasing rapidly. Already it has third place in
commercial importance amongst the cities of the
country, and its ambition is to rival Buenos Aires
itself.</p>

<p>Old timers&mdash;men who have been in the place a
dozen years&mdash;waxed enthusiastic to me about the
way in which an unpaved village, built on a flat, dusty,
treeless waste, has become a city of broad paved
streets and plazas, with imposing public buildings,
public gardens, electric tramways, electric light, and
an excellent water supply.</p>

<br /><br />


<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>

<p>There was something exhilarating in driving in
a motor-car along a busy thoroughfare, with big
shops on either side, and with clanging tramcars
picking up and dropping passengers, and to be
reminded that seven years before the place was
quite a wilderness. The way in which some men
had made money quickly made the mouth water
when one was shown a plot of land which had
originally been purchased for a few dollars, sold a
few years later for 10,000 dollars, and which had
changed hands only a month or two later for
30,000 dollars.</p>

<p>Though open to the scourge of disagreeable sand-storms&mdash;I
experienced one during my visit&mdash;the
town is well placed, with fine open spaces; and
though the public park is a little "raw," the fact
that there is a park at all, with excellent drives and
many trees, is the wonderful thing. I dined one
night at an excellent hotel, and afterwards accompanied
some friends to a wine hall, where men
brought their wives and children and witnessed a
pleasant kinematograph entertainment. Of course
there is an Argentine Club, and, though without the
sedate restfulness which English folk like to feel
is the characteristic of their clubs, its dimensions
and luxuriance provide a building which would be
a credit to any town three times its size. Bahia
Blanca has a model municipality, and, with all respect
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
to the Spanish-Italian Argentines, I believe the secret
is that the development of the town has been chiefly
in the hands of Englishmen.</p>

<p>With the opening of the country, fresh areas of
land placed under cultivation and with thousands
of miles lying at the back capable of wheat growing
and cattle raising, Bahia Blanca is swiftly coming
into its own. The land was practically useless so
long as there was no transport, but now, with the
Great Southern Railway, the Buenos Aires and
Pacific Railway and other lines converging upon the
town, every year marks an increase in trade. For
instance, in 1901 seventy vessels were cleared from
the port; in 1912 there were four hundred and
twenty-two. In the same two years the shipments
in wool jumped from 26,123 tons to 55,552; the
number of hides from 394 to 77,401; the tons of
hair from 3 to 248; and the tons of cereals from
188,875 to 1,747,702.</p>

<p>Let honour go where honour is due. It was the
coming of the railways which gave Bahia Blanca
its leap forward. In 1884 the Great Southern Railway
first pushed its rails so far south. They ran
through a country which, loosely, might be described
as desert. The bringing of the railway was like
putting new life into the desert. <i>Estancias</i> dotted
the landscape. In 1885 an insignificant mole was
built by the Great Southern to receive its own
materials, but this mole has developed into the
present Port of Engineer White&mdash;called after the
man who built it&mdash;which deals with over a million
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
tons of public traffic yearly. This port is a little
over four miles from Bahia Blanca, and has berths
for ten vessels of less draught. I climbed through
the two grain elevators, stacked with 26,000 tons
of wheat in sacks. By means of electric bands
grain can be conveyed to eight vessels at a time,
and in the busy season ships have been known to
take over five thousand tons in a little over six
hours. Being a place of yesterday's growth all the
newest appliances are to be found, including thirty
electric cranes, powerful tugs, floating grain elevators.
Indeed, the Southern company admit to an expenditure
on the port of £2,000,000.</p>

<p>But the port made by the Buenos Aires and Pacific
Railway Company, Puerto Galvan, occupying a
position of fine natural advantage on the estuary
of the bay and lying a mile or two across the flat
from Engineer White, has also to be seen. At high
tide there is a mean depth of twenty-eight feet, and
plenty of good anchorage is in the mainway. Puerto
Galvan is five miles from Bahia Blanca, and to a
great extent has been built on reclaimed swampy
ground. I see the day when warehouses and further
elevators will cover this piece of reclaimed mudbank,
and it should never be forgotten that Mr. Stevens,
the engineer, a man of great ability and much
modesty, has performed a fine piece of work. The
port has accommodation for twelve ocean-going
steamers, and the berths, which have a total length
of over 4,000 feet, have been constructed with a
view to the rapid handling of cargo. Here again
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
the appliances, elevators to handle 8,000 tons a
day, thirty-six cranes, traversers, capstans, are all
electrically driven. The total effective power amounts
to 4,265 horse-power. The port and the shunting
yards are all lit at night with electricity, and ships
can be illuminated. There are special facilities for
the embarkation of cattle. Large bonded warehouses
are in course of construction. There is a flour mill
with a capacity of 100 tons a day. Large storage
tanks have been erected for the accumulation of
crude oil, an important provision in a country so
deficient in coal. I looked across the sweep lying
between Puerto Galvan and Engineer White, and
visioned the day when it will be occupied with
warehouses and industrial enterprises, for oil fuel
and electric power can be quickly and cheaply
supplied.</p>

<p>One morning I visited the Victoria Wool Market,
long rows of well-built sheds, where not only wool
but cereals and general camp produce are sold. I
doubt if anywhere there is a similar market quite
so large, for it has a floor area of 484,000 square feet
and a storage capacity of 50,000 tons. Close by
are the deposits to receive the Mendoza wines, which
will have a profitable European sale when once the
supply grows beyond the Argentine demand. Then
there are deposits for the storage of alfalfa. The
spread of development was revealed by the remarks
which came in reply to my inquiries. "Oh, that
was built last year"; "This was erected a couple
of years ago, but we are going to make extensions";
"Five years ago we thought this place big enough,
but we are going to pull it down and put up something
ten times the size." Here was commercial
progress expanding monthly. Here was a town
which had been little more to me than a name on
the South American coast before I visited it&mdash;and
I consider myself a travelled man&mdash;and when I saw
its energy and its growth I wondered how much
the great industrial populations of crowded Europe
knew of what was taking place so many thousands
of miles across the sea.</p>

<p>The success of Bahia Blanca lies in the back
country known as the pampa. I journeyed across
it in a trip from Mendoza to Bahia Blanca, and, as
the name denotes, it is a vast featureless plain.
Most of it is naturally fertile, but even regions that
are sandy will be productive in the growing of alfalfa,
which seems specially suitable, and which will not
only maintain herds of cattle, but is profitable as a
feeding stuff to be exported. As yet the pampa
has been little more than scratched. From the railway
cars the idea is obtained that the whole of the
country is converted to the use of man. Ten or
twenty miles beyond the line you reach desert&mdash;desert
so far as use is concerned, though the illimitable
expanse of waving grass tells the tale of future
possibilities. Wherever the railways stretch their
arms there is cultivation, for the ever spreading
population follows quickly on the laying down of
the rails.</p>

<p>I have heard people talk about the monotony of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
the pampa. But this territory has a special fascination
of its own. There is a bigness, an immensity,
an unendingness which lays hold of the imagination.
The great silence, save for the play of the wind
amongst the long grass, seizes the fancy. Sunrise
and sunset come and go in a wonderful glory. At
the birth of day all the grass sparkles with dew;
the softest colours seem to brush the world. When
the sun is up, and blazes from a sky with all
the blue burnt out of it, a sort of oppressive hot
hush rests upon the world. The long grass seems
to drowse beneath the pitiless glare. You can travel
for hundreds of miles and never see a hillock or a
tree or a beast, or hear a bird. But into this land
man is slowly but persistently penetrating. To folk
who live at home the life seems deadening. Yet
men come to love it, not passionately but clingingly,
so that many a man who has "made his pile" and
returned home to spend it in ease begins to crave
for the pampa, and he is not content until he visits
it again.</p>

<p>Gradually this area is being transformed. <i>Estancias</i>,
with their eternal clump of trees and inevitable
windmill pump, break the line of the horizon. Cattle
stray over the prairie. The mud hovels of the
colonists are black specks, and when you reach
them you find that a big slice of the land has been
given to the plough and is fenced with wire. Here
also are the sheep farms, and, as I have indicated,
Bahia Blanca is the chief market for wool. Yet
sheep rearing in the Argentine, extensive though it is,
may be said to be stationary. This is not because
the limits of expansion have been reached, but
simply because cattle and wheat have been found
more profitable. The quality of wool, inferior to
that of Australia, may have something to do with
the restriction. The constant tendency is toward
hair, and the natural condition of wool is only maintained
by the importation of English sheep. Then
the animals are disposed to be gaunt rather than
good meat producers. These are drawbacks which
have had their influence on breeding as a money-making
business. But the Argentines are a practical
people, and everything connected with agriculture
they tackle in a scientific manner. That the consequence
of their experiments in cross breeding will
be the production of an acclimatised sheep, valuable
for wool or mutton or both, I have no doubt. Farther
south toward Patagonia, where the climate is more
temperate and where there is fodder, I look upon
as one of the great sheep tracks of the world. The
European market for chilled mutton will be a spur
to sheep-breeding.</p>

<p>Indeed, there are indications that the country
at the back of Bahia Blanca is being appreciated as
the sheep lands. It has been found that English
sheep do better here than elsewhere. The Lincoln,
Leicester, Romney Marsh, and Merino sheep do
well. There is a good opening in this area for the
British immigrant with money. Though there are
something approaching one hundred million sheep
in the Republic, there is room for hundreds of millions
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
more. But the indifferent strain, consequent on a
long-woolled Spanish breed having run wild for over
two hundred years, must be eradicated if Argentina
is going to secure and hold a foremost place in the
wool markets of the world. I have been told this
has been done during the last half century, but I
am by no means convinced. For a long time the
West Riding of Yorkshire had a prejudice against
Argentine wool. This no longer exists. The
preference is given to Australian wool not for
any patriotic reasons, but simply because it is
better.</p>

<p>Argentina has for some time been attracting
breeders from New Zealand, and they have done
much, by the importation of stock from England,
to improve the quality. At present three out of
every four sheep stations are in the hands of men
of British name. You can strike a line from a little
north of Bahia Blanca, and then reckon that most
of the country lying south, right down to Patagonia,
is suitable for sheep. But it is not all of equal
value. Sheep that are turned out on the alfalfa
lands provide good mutton, but the wool is inferior.
The fine grasses of the near south seem inclined to
make coarse wool; yet careful crossing is doing
much to prevent this. Still, I am strongly disposed
to agree with M. Bernandez, that there is no
reason why either the coarse or fine wools now
produced should be abandoned. The coarse, long
wool will always have its use not only in rough
goods, but also in the warp of fine cloths, which in
the great mechanical looms has to be extremely
strong. He looks to the establishment of woollen
manufactories in the Argentine, and, as a consequence,
the development on a colossal scale of all
the breeds.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

<h3>THE FUTURE OF AGRICULTURE</h3>


<p>It is, as I have abundantly shown, a simple truism
to say that Argentina is one of the principal agricultural
countries in the world. But how far is the
country going to advance?</p>

<p>In the great industrial lands of the earth the
tendency of population is away from the land. But
the increase of population means a bigger demand
for food. The time is swiftly coming when the
United States will have difficulty in growing sufficient
to feed her own people, and must look elsewhere.
The wheat area in Canada is immense, but its extent
is now well known. The wheat lands in the Dominion
are travelling farther north, and though a short
summer with long hours of sunshine are sufficient
speedily to raise crops, there is the danger&mdash;and it
is foolish to close one's eyes to it&mdash;that a summer
frost may produce a sudden shortage in the world's
wheat supply. Russia is capable of further development
in wheat growing, and there are huge possibilities
in Siberia, which, physically, is a twin country
to Canada. But the Russians are the poorest of
farmers, and the agricultural progress of the land
of the Tsar is doubtful.</p>

<p>Then there are plains of Australia which ought
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
to be doing much more in food production. But it
cannot be said that the native-born Australian is
really fond of life in the back blocks. Anyway, the
disproportionate size of the urban to the rural populations
would indicate he is not. Though of late
years something has been done to stimulate immigration,
the result is not sufficient to meet the needs
of a country like the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>One reason is that Australia is so much farther
off than Canada, and there is a belief amongst the
country people of Great Britain that the prospects
of success are not so immediate. Further, there is
the unfortunate but undoubted and growing idea
amongst Englishmen that Australians, as a whole,
are not kindly disposed to new-comers, and that
the fresh arrival has a rough time of it before he
shakes himself down to the fresh life. I do not
discuss these points. I mention their existence as
some reason why Australia is not able to play the
part it is entitled to play as a great wheat country.</p>

<p>Now the best wheat lands of Argentina lie within
the semi-tropical or temperate zone. I have already
explained why it does not have the attractions
which British colonies can offer to the man with
grit and muscle who desires to secure independence.
But it does draw to its shores a big army
of workers from Italy and Spain, without the ambition
of Britons and content to be the servants of other
men. Labour is comparatively cheap. The country
is easy to reach. The drift is not to the towns
but to the agricultural districts. The range for
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
wheat growing is boundless. But the possibility
of drought is not to be overlooked.</p>

<p>The money invested in agriculture falls short of
that invested in live stock. But there are more
persons directly interested in the growing of cereals,
and I am one of those who believe it counts more
for the genuine, happy prosperity of a nation that
a large proportion of the population should be
attached to the soil than when greater wealth is
secured by a smaller number. In my opinion it
would be better if there were easier means for the
comparatively small holder, the man with anything
from three hundred to a thousand acres, to settle.
I was not unconscious of a movement, such as there
is in Australia, to break up the big estates, but at
the present it is nebulous, merely something in the
air; and though the Latins, when they act, will
act swiftly, the type of colonist and labourer who
lands, though he votes Socialist when he gets the
chance, is not of the brand to take vigorous political
action to secure land. His conditions are improved
in comparison within his native country, and he
is inclined for the present to be content.</p>

<p>There is, however, a rustling amongst the leaves.
There is a feeling amongst Argentine politicians
that the peon and the colonist have little chance of
becoming owners of small farms unless they are
assisted by credit banks. Various proposals have
been made; but the one now before the Chamber
of Deputies, fathered by the Minister of Agriculture,
provides for the establishment of agricultural banks
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
and the erection of warehouses to receive produce
as a pledge against cash advances.</p>

<p>It is reckoned that between £8,000,000 and
£9,000,000 is necessary to set the scheme on its
legs, and the idea is that the State should find half
the money and private capital provide the other
half.</p>

<p>Further, as most of the best land is in large
estates and private ownership, there is a growing
public opinion that the Government would do well
if it bought up some of these enormous <i>estancias</i> at
their present value, cut them into small holdings,
and let them on the deferred payment system to
colonists. This would require enormous capital,
State provided. But, human nature being what it
is, men in one part of the country are opposed to
finding money for the benefit of another part. They
do not look upon it as a national investment which
will bring good return to the State as a whole so
much as increasing the productivity and population
in particular parts. However, some progress has
been made when you get a general consensus that,
unbounded though Argentina's capabilities are, closer
settlement is necessary to provide ballast in the
economic progress of the nation.</p>

<p>"Give us of the best; let us be up-to-date and
scientific; let us have the latest twentieth-century
equipment so that Argentina may have first place"&mdash;that
is the temper of the people toward agriculture.
Much has been done, an amazing amount, to place
Argentina in the front line of agrarian education.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
In giving praise there is, I know, always the danger
of overdoing it. And whilst the Argentine has a
good conceit of himself, he has the quality, not always
readily discernible in a new country, of being able
to see his weak points and being willing to learn.
Here is a frank statement which I cull from the
<i>Anales de la Sociedad Rural Argentine</i>: "Up to the
present agriculture has hardly been carried on in
a scientific, regular, methodic, reasonable and economic
manner with the endeavour to get from the
soil all the benefit and yield it can give. The
empiric methods of cultivation often employed up
to now have given profits on account of the fertility
of the land, its exuberance, which, without great
expense, yields a return far larger than the general
average known in other agricultural countries."</p>

<p>Less than forty years ago it took Argentina all
its time to grow enough wheat to supply its own
needs, though its population was only a third what
it is at present. Within the memory of many
Argentina had to import wheat. Indeed, as near
as 1876 thousands of tons of flour had to be brought
into the country. It is the recollection of this, in
comparison with the conditions to-day, which proclaims
better than any attempts at fine writing the
strides which have been made. Look at the jumps.
In 1888 the crops covered some 6,076,500 acres,
representing an increase of 4,626,500 acres in sixteen
years, an addition that seven years later had
reached 6,012,000 acres. By 1895 the total was
12,088,000. Then came the wave. By 1908 the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
total was 43,692,228 acres, an increase of 31,603,728
acres in thirteen years, or 261 per cent. In 1911
the area cultivated was 54,258,772 acres, and at
the time of writing it must be approaching 70,000,000
acres. That tells its own story. Yet only one-sixth
of the country suitable for cultivation has been
broken by the plough. The value of the principal
products of Argentine agriculture, wheat, maize,
oats and linseed, for 1913 is estimated at something
over £80,000,000.</p>

<p>One strong advantage Argentina has is that the
crops are spread over an extensive area. They are
grown in regions so far distant from one another
that no fear is felt at any time of a total loss of the
harvest. The Republic now sends her products to
countries that were her purveyors up to a few years
ago. In the production of linseed she has first place
amongst the nations. In maize she figures in the
third place, coming after North America and Austria-Hungary;
but in export of maize she comes first.
In the production of wheat Argentina holds the
sixth position, coming after the United States,
Russia, France, India, and Austria-Hungary; but
in export of wheat and flour she has first rank. We
in Britain have Canada so much before our eyes that
we assume her progress is unequalled. The <i>Anales
de la Sociedad Rural Argentine</i> is responsible for some
interesting comparisons directed to show that the
Argentine farmer can produce for 43s. 5d. an acre
what it costs the Canadian farmer 88s. 4d. to produce.
Whilst the occupancy of land has increased
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
75 per cent. in thirty years in Canada, it has increased
by 284 per cent. in Argentina. Whilst
Canada has 20,000,000 more acres occupied than
Argentina, the Republic is far ahead of the Dominion
in the value of her live stock.</p>

<p>Though the capabilities of Argentina in wheat
growing have been known for centuries, and have
not recently come in the nature of a revelation as
may be said in regard to Canada, the reason the boom
has been so long delayed has been because the country
was in the throes of revolution, thereby frightening
off foreign capital, and because of the lack of transport.
But revolutions can now be described as things
of the past, and for its population Argentina has the
longest mileage of railways in the world. The day is
not far distant when Argentina will produce 10,000,000
tons of wheat a year. Remarkable and gratifying,
from a trader's point of view, though her increase
of exports are, the figures are not so satisfying from
a national standpoint. Her increase of population,
big though it is, is by no means keeping pace with
her increase in productivity.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the spread of agricultural education,
I must say that full value is not got out of
the land. Much of the farming is slovenly. This
is partly due to race, but chiefly because the farmers
are not owners, but only occupiers in return for
giving a proportion of the crop to the owner. Further,
if there is an unsatisfactory season the colonists
neglect the land, take their departure, and try their
luck elsewhere. The Argentines are conscious of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
the difficulties, and, as I have indicated, the remedy
will probably be found by the State purchasing
great estates, cutting them into small farms, and
letting the colonists become the owners on easy
terms. In alluding to the immigration in a former
chapter I mentioned that a number of Italians and
Spaniards return to their own countries. The
migrated Latin always finds the old country pulling
at his heart-strings&mdash;a feeling, however, which
completely disappears in succeeding generations.
But the immigrants who go to Argentina to make
money rather than to settle are inclined to be reckless
concerning care for the soil. The rough-and-ready,
haphazard, careless farming is, of course,
understandable in a new and fertile country. Only
the passage of years and closer settlement, and therefore
more careful culture, will tend to put things
right.</p>

<p>The average production of wheat in Argentina
is only 11.3 bushels per acre, which is about the
same as Australia. Canada does better than that,
for Manitoba can give 13&frac12; bushels to the acre and
Saskatchewan 17 bushels. In England the yield
to-day is 30 bushels. Germany has the same return,
whilst Roumania has 23 bushels and France 20 bushels
to the acre. There is not the slightest doubt that
with improved conditions of cultivation Argentina
can do much better than she is doing. The United
Kingdom is now purchasing over £30,000,000 worth
of foodstuffs a year from the Argentine. Indeed,
the Republic supplies us with a quarter of the food
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
we purchase from abroad. In cereals alone we
purchased in 1912 from Argentina 619,000 tons of
wheat, 592,000 tons of maize, 60,000 tons of linseed
and 383,000 tons of oats.</p>

<p>Mr. C. P. Ogilvie, one of the most astute authorities
on the development of Argentina, and whom
I had the pleasure of meeting in Buenos Aires, has
demonstrated how the growing of alfalfa is useful
for resting the land after crops of wheat, maize, etc.
I have already told of the way this sanfoin plant has
the property of attaching to itself micro-organisms
which draw the nitrogen in the air and make it available
for plant food. Every colonist knows the value
of alfalfa for feeding his cattle, says Mr. Ogilvie,
but it is not every colonist who knows why this
plant occupies such a high place amongst feeding
stuffs. Alfalfa is easily grown, very strong when
established, and, provided its roots can get to water,
will go on growing for years. The <i>raison d'être</i> for
growing alfalfa is the feeding of cattle and preparing
them for market, and for this purpose a
league of alfalfa (6,177 acres metric measurement)
will carry on an average 3,500 head. When grown
for dry fodder it produces three or four crops per
annum, and a fair yield is from six to eight tons
per acre of dry alfalfa for each year. A ton of such
hay is worth about twenty to thirty dollars, and, after
deducting expenses, there is a clear return of about
fourteen dollars per acre. The figures supplied by
one large company show that on an average cattle,
when placed upon alfalfa lands, improve in value
at the rate of two dollars per head per month, so
it is easy to place a value upon its feeding properties.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>

<p>Thus, Mr. Ogilvie proceeds, we will take a camp
under alfalfa capable of carrying 10,000 head of
cattle all the year round, where, as the fattened
animals are sold off, an equal number is bought
to replace them. Such a camp would bring in a
clear profit of 200,000 dollars sterling. An animal
that has been kept all its life on a rough camp, and
when too old for breeding is placed for the first time
on alfalfa lands, fattens extremely quickly, and the
meat is tender and in quality compares favourably
with any other beef. No business in Argentina of
the same importance has shown such good returns
as cattle breeding, and these results have been
chiefly brought about by the introduction of alfalfa,
and a knowledge of the life history of alfalfa is of
the greatest importance to the cattle farmer. All
cereal crops take from the soil mineral matter and
nitrogen. Therefore, after continuous cropping, the
land becomes exhausted, and generally poorer.
Experience has taught us that rotation of crops is
a necessity to alleviate the strain on the soil....
If soils were composed of nothing but pure silica
sand, nothing would ever grow; but in Nature
we find that soils contain all sorts of mineral matter,
and chief among these is lime. Alfalfa thrives on
land which contains lime, and gives but poor results
where this ingredient is deficient. The explanation
is simple. There is a community of interest between
the very low microscopic animal life known as bacteria
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1962" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
and plant life generally. In every ounce of
soil there are millions of these living germs, which
have their allotted work to do, and they thrive best
in soils containing lime. If one takes up with great
care a root of alfalfa, and care is taken in exposing
the root, some small nodules attached to the fine
hair-like roots are easily distinguished by the naked
eye, and these nodules are the home of a teeming
microscopic industrious population, who perform
their allotted work with the silent persistent energy
so often displayed in Nature. Men of science have
been able to identify at least three classes of these
bacteria, and to ascertain the work accomplished
by each. The reason for their existence would seem
to be that one class is able to convert the nitrogen
in the air into ammonia, whilst others work it into
nitrate, and the third class so manipulate it as to
form a nitrate which is capable of being used for
plant food. Now, although one ton of alfalfa removes
from the soil 50 lb. of nitrogen, yet that
crop leaves the soil richer in nitrogen, because the
alfalfa has encouraged the multiplication of those
factories which convert some of the thousands of
tons of nitrogen floating above the earth into substance
suitable for food for plant life. As a dry
fodder for cattle, three tons of alfalfa has as much
nutrition as two tons of wheat.</p>

<p>The cost of growing alfalfa depends largely on
the situation of the land, and whether labour is
plentiful. But, says Mr. Ogilvie, we will imagine
the intrinsic value of the undeveloped land to be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
£4,000, upon which, under existing conditions, it
would be possible to keep 1,000 head of animals,
whereas if this same land were under alfalfa 3,000
to 3,500 animals could be fattened thereon, and
the land would have increased in value to £20,000
or £30,000. To improve the undeveloped land it
must be worked, and the plan usually adopted is
to let the land to colonists who have had experience
in the class of work. Colonists usually undertake
to cultivate 500 to 600 acres. They pay to
the landlord anything from 10 per cent. to 30 per
cent. of the crops, according to distance of the land
from the railway. The first crop grown on fresh
broken soil is generally maize. The second year's
crop linseed, and probably a third year's crop of
wheat is grown before handing back the land to
the owner, ready to be put down in alfalfa. Sometimes
the alfalfa is sown with the colonist's last
crop, the landlord finding the alfalfa seed. After
the completion of the contract the colonist moves
to another part. The owner, who has annually
received a percentage of the crops, takes back his
land. Fences now will necessitate a considerable
outlay, also wells and buildings. The more of these
the better, as the land will carry a larger head of
cattle, and the camp being properly divided makes
the control of the cattle easy.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>Allowing for the disadvantages&mdash;stretches of
drought, pests of locusts&mdash;I know of no new country
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
balancing one thing with another, where the future
is so bright. Given a good year, an Argentine farmer
makes 30 per cent. on his invested capital. He
thinks he is doing fairly well if he gets 20 per cent.
He grumbles if his return is only 10 per cent. He
can afford to have one bad year in three&mdash;I believe
the average works out one in five&mdash;and yet be doing
very well compared with farmers in some other parts
of the world.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

<h3>MENDOZA</h3>


<p>If I were called upon to make my personal choice
in which part of the Republic I would like to live,
I would choose Mendoza&mdash;or at any rate some part
of Mendoza province. It lies far west, within the
shadow of the snow-crowned Andes. The glacier-fed
rivers from the mountains are making it one
of the biggest vineyards in the world. The city is
several thousand feet above sea level, and the air
is clear and invigorating. Like most Spanish-Argentine
towns, it has a long history, but its tale
of abounding progress does not stretch beyond the
last seven or eight years. There are over a quarter
of a million people in the province, and the capital
numbers nearly 70,000 of them.</p>

<p>It is the old story of "Go west, my son." Whenever
I fell into praise about places in the east, or
in the middle parts of the country, there was generally
somebody at my elbow to whisper, "Ah, but
wait till you get to Mendoza."</p>

<p>Hardened traveller though I am, I admit a
little thrill of anticipation when, after a hot and
rather dusty day in the railway cars, I first caught
a glimpse of the gleaming Cordillera, and then ran
long miles through flourishing vineyards. So right
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
into the heart of the town of luxuriant avenues,
through the main street it seemed, with tall poplar
trees on either side, and beyond the cool road rows
of picturesque but modest houses, white washed,
blue washed, pink washed, and even with a touch of
quaintness about the houses that seemed to be
neglected. Thus I made acquaintance with a city
of broad boulevards and fine squares, an extensive
park, and announcing its prosperity to all who pass
that way and have eyes to see.</p>

<p>But whilst there is much to be enthusiastic about,
it is well not to let enthusiasm run away with one.
There was nothing of the raw west about the people.
The ladies were as well dressed as those you will
see in the Rue de la Paix. Then I was reminded
that every woman out here dresses as well as she
knows how, even though she and her family live
sparsely at home. People judge their fellows by
appearance, by show, and everyone feels it a duty
to be ostentatious. Next I was impressed with
the extraordinary number of motor-cars. "Yes,"
remarked my Mendoza-English friend, "but I think
there is only half the number now that there were
a couple of years ago. You had to own a motor-car,
or you were not considered worth knowing.
We had nearly three hundred motor-cars, the best
the United States or France could supply, and their
value ran into millions of dollars. People had them
with little prospect of paying for them. But then,
everybody is optimistic, expecting a pot of money
to be coming along soon. There is lots of money,
but some folks did not get what they expected, and so
a great many of the cars have been seized for debt."</p>

<p>We were making a little tour in a car. Most of
the houses are single-storied as a provision against
earthquakes, which are not infrequent in these parts.
Indeed, one morning during my stay, whilst I was
shaving, there was a quiver and a jolt which I thought
was due to some heavily laden train passing. At
breakfast I learnt there had been a respectable
earthquake. Everybody tells you about the great
earthquake of 1861, which completely destroyed old
Mendoza. The only remaining evidences are the
ruins of the cathedral. The population of the city
at that time was 20,000, and I was told that half
the population was killed. Then there was the agony
of fire, and&mdash;with horror piled on horror, as those
were lawless days&mdash;bands of miscreants began plundering
and murdering the affrighted inhabitants who
remained. Tremors are now frequent, and the prospect
of another earthquake is like an abiding nightmare.
That is why the streets are so wide, the
houses nearly all of a single story, and made of a
particularly light brick with a considerable admixture
of cane amongst the clay, so that the structure
has a springiness and does not crack when the shake
comes. Really the only big and substantial buildings
are the Legislature and the Palace of Justice,
and they are imposing.</p>

<p>Mendoza continually reminded me of Salt Lake
City. Like the capital of the Mormon faith, it is
in the lee of a mighty mountain range; there are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
trees bordering most of the streets, and along the
main ways are innumerable rivulets. Boys are constantly
employed to souse the road with water and
so keep it cool. The entrance to Western Park
has exquisite bronze gates. It is rather surprising,
however, to see they are mounted with imperial
crowns. The explanation is that they were originally
made for Abdul Hamid, the deposed Sultan of
Turkey. Owing to political upheaval in Turkey
they were never delivered, because there was no
one prepared to pay for them. Mendoza made a
bid and bought them for £5,000. Broad roads
through this lovely domain, leading through avenues
of trees and past radiant flower gardens, make the
Western Park beloved of Mendozians. There is a
band-stand; and on Thursday evenings, the whole
place flashing with electric light, the road is blocked
with automobiles and carriages, and thousands of
people listening to the music. There is a rustic
chalet where people can sit and have refreshment.
There is a lake nearly a mile long. Here take place
boating races, and for the accommodation of the
spectators there is a grand stand which can hold
3,000 persons. There is a zoological garden. There
is what is called "The Lilliputian Railway," so that
a tiny little train starting from a miniature station
can take passengers all over the extensive park,
through tropical vegetation, up tiny valleys, diving
through small tunnels, giving anybody who cannot
provide a private carriage an easy and cheap means
of seeing the park.</p>

<p>Mendoza occupies a prominent place amongst
the cities of Argentina. It is a magnet of attraction,
especially to Italians who have experience in wine
making; and now every year the province receives
something over fifteen thousand immigrants. Some
freshly developed countries have a law that no
immigrant shall enter under "contract," that no
man shall (without special permission) be allowed
to land if he has a job and a definite wage awaiting
him. There is no such regulation in Argentina.
There is an Immigration Law under which fresh
arrivals are housed and fed by the Government,
and work found for them. But less than half come
within the operation of the law. About 150,000
fresh arrivals every year come out to situations, or
have sufficient money to look after their own interests,
and naturally many of these strike far west to
Mendoza.</p>

<p>As I have intimated in an earlier chapter, the
Federal Government has occasionally a little difficulty
owing to the independent spirit of provinces
like Mendoza. Mendoza, for instance, has its own
paper money, so that whilst the Federal dollars are
acceptable in the province, the Mendozian dollars
are not currency beyond its own borders. It has
all the modern equipment of government: a House
of Senators and a House of Deputies. Each eight
thousand inhabitants are entitled to a deputy, and
each department or county returns one senator.
The trouble of some democratic lands, strikes, are
prohibited, and if attempted the soldiers are called
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
out. The Governor is elected for four years. Voting
is obligatory, and if a man will not vote he is put
in prison. The State has full legal equipment in
one supreme court, two courts of appeal, and two
criminal courts. Whilst there is a public prosecutor
there is a State lawyer, whose business it is to defend
the poor, and another to defend minors when they
come within reach of the arm of the law. Taxes are
not high. There is a considerable amount of Government
land, and this is sold in order to raise money
for public works. Of course, there is the usual boom
in land values. In 1909 the estimated value of property
in the province (vineyards, orchards, cultivated
and uncultivated land, and buildings) was a
little over £50,000,000. Up to July 31st, 1913,
property had increased in value to well over
£70,000,000. This is creditable for a population
of 260,000.</p>

<p>In no other province in the Republic has there
been so much land sold as in Mendoza. From
1909 to 1912 inclusive transactions in land represented
a turnover of £37,000,000. In the neighbourhood
of Mendoza City land is as dear as close
to Buenos Aires, rising to £2 a metre (3.28 feet).
In 1909 193,061 hectares (hectare = 2.47 acres) was
under cultivation. Now there are 330,000 hectares.
Development is not restricted to the neighbourhood
of the provincial capital. Take San Juan, in the
north, an old town which jogged along with viticulture
till ten years ago, when it made a bound,
and progress in growing grapes has been considerable.</p>

<p>Some six hours by rail south-east of Mendoza
is San Rafael. Twenty-five years ago the only
flourishing product was the Indian; and you could
have bought quantities of land at twopence a hectare.
To-day ordinary uncultivated land with water rights
is worth from £140 to £160 per hectare. Cultivated
vineyards are worth from £600 to £650 per hectare,
according to class. Till 1903 San Rafael had no
railway connection with anywhere. The journey
to Mendoza, which is now done in half a dozen
hours by train, then took eight days by cart. Railway
building has facilitated the development of the
San Rafael district, which is just at the doorway
of its prosperity. The San Rafael grape has a richer
colour and more sugar than the Mendoza grape.
If I had a large sum to invest I think I would take
my chances at San Rafael.</p>

<p>Now, whilst there is all this material progress,
it was refreshing to note that care is given to other
things than just money making. I have described
the constant movement to beautify Mendoza. Education
is carefully nurtured. In the province are
(1913) two national high-grade colleges, two normal
schools, twenty-five private schools, and one kindergarten.
This kindergarten is, so far as my knowledge
goes, unmatched in the world. It was not the size
that impressed me, but the thought-out plans to
provide everything to attract and stimulate the
young intelligence. Beauty is the basis, not only
in the schoolrooms but in the theatre and playgrounds.
Whether it be a school, or a fire-station,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
or a penitentiary, expenditure is lavish in providing
a handsome building. Of course ambition, rivalry,
town conceit&mdash;the desire to show something better
than another town can show&mdash;is behind much of the
enterprise. But the result is there, and it is the
fact that counts.</p>

<p>Primarily, this abounding fortune of Mendoza is
due to its vineyards. I read in an official publication
that the province has the finest soil in the Republic.
That is incorrect; but it has a soil that is peculiarly
adapted for vines, together with a climate
and a situation which for viticulture could not be
improved&mdash;though there is a fly in the ointment,
of which more anon. Besides, the inhabitants have
not had to grope their way in the growing of grapes
and the making of wine, as has been the case in
many instances in California and South Australia,
good though some of the wines are, through the
cultivators coming from lands where the grape
industry is not natural. It may be fairly said that
all the folk in the province engaged in viticulture
are from the wine-growing regions of Italy and
Spain. Further, wine has been made in this region
for several hundreds of years, though in the absence
of transport its consumption was purely local. Now
it is drunk throughout the Republic.</p>

<p>Neither the Californians nor the Australians are
a wine-drinking people. Wine producers have to
look to markets beyond the seas. Not so the Mendozians.
The Argentines, being Latin, are a wine-drinking
people. Everybody drinks wine. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
labourer on the railway has wine with his frugal
lunch. It is not at all unusual for children to have
watered wine with their meals. On the big emigrant
ships wine is included in the charge for fare and
food.</p>

<p>Well, here is a wine-drinking population of
7,000,000 living next door to the vineyards. Therefore
the market for wine is enormous. Great though
the output is, it does not meet the demand. As
a consequence scant justice, from a connoisseur's
point of view, is done to the Argentine wine, for
it never has an opportunity to mature. Again, the
wine is cheap; and it would never suit the wealthy
Argentines if they were seen drinking anything but
expensive foreign wine. I did taste some wine with
delightful bouquet, such as that of the Château
Norton; but, as it is the crowd which drinks the
wine, it cannot be said that the average quality of
native produce is high. With such piled-up orders
for quantity, growers have not bothered very much
about quality. They told me that sometimes they
have felt rather ashamed to send out wine sour
with youth; yet the dealers must have it. More
than once the railway companies have been congested
with barrels ready to be taken east. There are
millions of acres, as yet untouched, suitable for vines.</p>

<p>When one thinks of the people in South America,
and of the prospective expansion of population, all
wine-drinkers, one must conclude that the future of
this land, amongst the foothills of the Andes, is very
bright. In the turn of time some rich Argentines
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
will set the fashion of drinking the wine of their
own country. That will call for the production of
a better vintage, and then, very likely, Argentine
wines will be introduced to the other markets of
the world. As it is, fortunes are being rapidly made.
Many of the vineyards are quite small. Two and a
half acres (one hectare) will grow between three and
four hundredweight of grapes, which can be looked
after by one man, and ought, in an ordinary season,
to yield an income of about £100. A family with a
small holding of four or five hectares can live most
comfortably. In 1913 the province produced
592,969,670 kilos (kilo = 2.20 lb.). Of this 399,517,099
litres of wine were elaborated (litre = 0.22 gallon).</p>

<p>Now I have mentioned there is a fly in the ointment,
and I should not be doing my duty if I failed
to call attention to it. The soil is there, the climate
is there, grapes are carefully acclimatised. But there
must be water, and whether there will always be a
sufficiency of this is a doubt which sometimes comes
into the minds of men who glance ahead. The
rainfall is not heavy. Various scientific experiments
have been made to attract rain, but without much
success. The principal supply is from the River
Mendoza, fed by the melting of the snows in the
mountains. At first the wine growers helped themselves
to what water they desired. But as the
industry developed, and as there was suitable land
without water, irrigation canals were introduced.
Sometimes a man tapped water to which he was
not entitled, and then there was trouble. As a
consequence, the Government has boldly grappled
with the problem of irrigation. I drove out about
a dozen miles to inspect a weir which had been
constructed across the Mendoza River. This holds
back an immense quantity of water, and the supply
is regulated by the weir gates. Irrigation channels
zigzag across the country, and the cultivator pays
a small sum for his supply. These works fertilise
over a million acres of land. Irrigated land has
bounced in value. Waterless land which could have
been obtained for £1 a hectare now fetches twenty,
or even thirty times as much. This has emboldened
the Government into making contracts for several
million dollars for the damming of smaller rivers,
and providing further irrigation works. Still, there
is much water which goes down the River Mendoza
that is not used at all. I asked a man who has the
right to speak as an authority how much country
could be placed under viticulture if all the available
water supply was nursed and utilised. He told
me three times as much as at present. So, although
there is a big difficulty ahead, it is so far distant
that the average man of the present generation does
not bother his head much about it.</p>

<p>There are just 873 bodegas in Mendoza, though
800 of them are comparatively small. I went over
two of the biggest and found them equipped as
well as the bodegas of Europe. Some of the vats
hold tens of thousands of litres of wine. Modern
vats are built of cement lined with glass, and one
of them will hold over 100,000 litres. But what
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
was annoying&mdash;it is exercised elsewhere&mdash;was the
practice of giving a well-known name to a wine
which it does not properly represent. There is
nothing so delicate as the grape in being affected
by soil. Similar vines, but grown on slightly dissimilar
soil, produce a different quality of grape,
and give quite a different flavour to the wine. So,
generally speaking, the wine of Argentina has a
different tone from that of France, Italy, or Spain.
The vintners endeavour by blending to produce a
European type, a hock, a moselle, a burgundy, a
medoc, a bordeaux, even a champagne&mdash;which, though
good wines, are not always good imitations of something
else. It would be much better if they classified
and titled their own wines. The European plan of
one type of wine being produced in one particular
district is ignored. Therefore you will find the big
bodega producing from grapes grown in one vineyard
a dozen brands which originated in France, Germany,
Spain, Italy, and Portugal.</p>

<p>It might be thought that in Mendoza, where wine
is the cheapest beverage procurable except water,
there would be drunkenness. Not at all. Perhaps
the case of the people is like that of the girls in
confectionery shops; there are so many sweets
about they never think of making themselves ill.
Now and then, however, there is a relapse. But a
Mendozian "drunk" is not fined and sent to prison.
Armed with a pail, he has to give two or three days
to getting water out of the rivulets which run down
the sides of the main streets, and sprinkling the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
dusty road with it. This is work usually given to
boys. So when you see a disgruntled man engaged
at it you will be quite right in coming to the conclusion
he has been imbibing, and the authorities
have put him to this job to disgrace him.</p>

<p>I have dealt rather fully with the wine-making
business because it is the chief source of the Province
of Mendoza's prosperity. But it is a happy
country for other kinds of fruit, particularly the
peach. Also there are oranges, figs, quinces, nectarines,
and cherries. Several fruit canning
concerns, turning out many thousand tins of fruit
a day, have sprung into existence and are doing
well. Abundance of fruit has been rather a cause
of neglect in rearing, so that I do not place the
quality too high. For instance, the oranges are not
within measurable distance of the splendid oranges
which New South Wales grows. Improvement will
assuredly come in time. As it is, the fruit season
in Argentina is when it is raw winter in Europe;
and, as transport is quickening, possibilities of an
extended market are great. Sometimes I hear
young Englishmen, discontented with home, say
they would like to go to America and start fruit
farming. They might inquire into the prospects
of Mendoza.</p>

<h3>A TRIP INTO THE ANDES</h3>


<p>It was intended to be a jolly party. We were going
to Puerta del Inca and to make a picnic of it. There
was the Englishman, born in Australia, trained in
the United States and now an engineering expert in
Argentina. He was the biggest man I met in the
Republic, and his friends called him "Chico," which
means the little one. There was the Scot, grizzled and
cautious, who disappeared for months and was away
exploring the unknown mountains up in the snows,
carrying his camp with him, never seeing anybody
with whom he could converse, coming back with
maps of possible new routes over the frozen shoulders
of the Andes, and who loved long hours in the English
Club in Mendoza, expressing Carlylean views about
the world, quoting poetry and enjoying long games
at cards. There was the man who came out here
from England many years ago to help in the building
of the Transandine railway, married a Spanish wife,
has taken to vine growing, and knows he now speaks
his native tongue with a foreign accent. There were
others, men who had knocked about the world and
had done things; men with none of the light talk
of stay-at-home Englishmen, but showing strong
character kneaded by rough circumstances.</p>

Club. It was when the night was warm and we
stretched in easy chairs, puffing smoke rings at the
moon. "Chico" was master of ceremonies. What
he arranged was to be right. And we were to be
ready early the next morning, for a special coach was
to be fastened to the express coming through from
Buenos Aires on its way to Valparaiso.</p>

<p>The early morning air was crisp and invigorating.
The transcontinental train had just come in, and
whilst the early birds were out on the platform, half-drawn
blinds revealed the drowsy countenances of
other travellers who had no disposition for a peep
at Mendoza, or who had seen it before and lacked
ambition to see it again. There was the usual
jostling on the platform of folk who had just arrived
and those who were taking their departure, joyous
greetings, and sad farewells. The stranger had to
stand on one side and smile at the way Argentine
men held one another by one arm half round the neck,
and with the other hand gave continuous slaps in the
small of the back. Yesterday morning's papers from
Buenos Aires had arrived, and there was a scramble
round the bookstall whilst the slow-moving newsboy
undid the strings and we could buy our newspapers,
and were able to read what the Prime Minister of
England had been saying the day before yesterday.</p>

<p>"Chico," with hat stuck on the back of his head,
hastened up to our group with the intimation that
we had better get on board if it was not our intention
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
to be left behind. "Have you got plenty of food,"
was the inquiry, "for we are as hungry as hunters?"
"Yes, plenty," was the answer. "And drink?"
"And the drink." "You have not forgotten the
cigars?" "No, the cigars are all right."</p>

<p>Our car was attached to the express. It was a
long, narrow car, with a table down the centre. We
were met with the refreshing odour of ham and eggs
being prepared in the adjoining kitchen.</p>

<p>The long train panted toward the hills, leaving
leafy Mendoza behind and winding away through
aisles of great grey boulders by the side of the muddy
Mendoza River. There was a dreary forlornness
about the country as the train, with the river as its
guide, seemed to be making for a huge black cutting
in the mountains. We did not mind, for the Spanish
cook and his assistant were busy serving us with ham
and eggs, and coffee, and freshly baked rolls.</p>

<p>Maybe it was the breakfast, or the exhilarating
air of the hills, or the genial company, or the pleasure
of the post-breakfast cigar; but we were the merriest
party imaginable. The engineer who had turned vine
grower became reminiscent of the days when he
helped to build this line, and of how, when work
was over in the evening, he frequently mounted his
horse, rode twenty miles to attend a Spanish dance,
mounted his horse again at four in the morning, and
was back at work in the hills by sunrise. Of course,
he was quite sure that those were romantic and
adventurous days compared with the present.</p>

<p>We were not travelling fast. The line was gradually
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
rising, and the engine was giving off sounds
as though it were suffering from asthma. We got
into country&mdash;wild, moorlike, and broken with many
streams&mdash;which reminded some of us of parts of
Scotland. We struck into what had looked like a
black defile, through which the river came racing,
and on either side of us rose gaunt rocks, black
and brown, which suggested that a terrific fire had
once raged.</p>

<p>No snow was in sight&mdash;nothing but fierce, repellent
crags. Suddenly we came upon an upland valley
with a wide stretch of grass, a straggling village, and
a big hotel&mdash;just the sort of hotel you are constantly
bumping into in the Swiss mountains. The passing
of the train for Chili is probably the one excitement.
The Italian folk gathered about the little station
and gazed with curious eyes at the passengers.</p>

<p>Years ago I went down Kicking Horse Pass, in
the Canadian Rockies, with a seat on the "cow-catcher."
It was now my good fortune to ride on
the "cow-catcher" of this train bound for Valparaiso.
As luck would have it, I met an American
and his wife whose acquaintance I had made on the
Atlantic, and to whom I had bidden "good-bye"
at Rio de Janeiro. They were now returning to the
United States by way of Chili, and, being of an
adventurous turn of mind, they, too, were eager to
enjoy a ride on the front of the engine. Over the
"cow-catcher" a seat was fixed, with a brass rail
in front so that there was little danger of falling off.
We knew how cold it would be later, and so we put
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
on our heaviest coats and wrapped ourselves in our
thickest rugs. We were "in the front row" to
obtain a view.</p>

<p>The way was now increasingly steep. It was
necessary to have two engines, one in front to pull
and one behind to push. Slowly we grunted on our
way. There was a chill ping in the air which made
our cheeks smart. We kept close to the river, as
though it were a guide that we did not intend to
allow to forsake us. Sometimes we ran not far
above the level of the scouring waters. At other
times we seemed to be running along a high-perched
ledge on the rock side, so that when the engine gave
a sudden swerve round the elbow of a hill there
was one traveller who shut his eyes when he
thought what might happen if the engine had
suddenly taken it into its head to make a leap into
the abyss.</p>

<p>The hills closed in. They towered above us so
that there was the sense of going through a long
gully. At every turn the engine shrieked, and the
echoes reverberated amongst the mountains. Now
and then we came upon gangmen engaged in the
repair of the line. They jumped aside whilst the
train trundled by.</p>

<p>Then came a dip, with a great open, verdurous
cañon in front of us. The steam of the engine was
shut off, and the train seemed to free-wheel into
the valley. We jumped and rocked and curved in
the most exciting way. There was no protecting
fence. We gave a start when, swinging round the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
bend, we came across a couple of scampering horses.
We held our breath, for it seemed certain we should
crush into them. One animal gave a violent jump
amongst the adjoining boulders, and then, when we
were within a dozen yards of the other horse, it
swerved, and we just missed hitting it.</p>

<p>Again we started climbing. We ran past tiny
stations, and on the hillsides, where there was vegetation,
we could see little chalets and horses and
cattle about. Once we had to cross a bridge very
slowly, for it was under extensive repair. The chief
engineer was a young Englishman, and he ran up
and exchanged a few words with friends. We went
through long black tunnels, and the experience was
eerie, for the engine shrieked like a maniac that was
being chased.</p>

<p>Still we kept fairly close to the Mendoza River.
At one spot the hills widened out where a tributary,
the Rio Blanco, ran into the main stream. At the
joining place there was a chasm which it would have
required an enormous bridge to span. We avoided
that difficulty by the line running a little distance
on one side by the Rio Blanco to where the valley
narrowed so we could cross by a small bridge; and
then the train started going the other way on the
other side of the fall, and proceeded with the Mendoza
River on the right, having dodged the chasm by a
sort of V-shaped loop.</p>

<p>By the side of the chasm was a melancholy little
cemetery. There was no grass, or trees, or flowers;
just a group of uneven headstones telling of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
last resting-place of the men who had died years
before whilst engaged in constructing the line.</p>

<p>We now seemed to be running along a scooped-out
way over a great height of shingle. We knew
it was here that some of the hardest work was done
in building the line. For after the melting of the
snows and the torrential rains, great masses of shingle
rolled, breaking the line, and on one occasion throwing
a whole train and the engine right into the
bottom of the river. One felt that the engine itself
was trembling with fear as it made a path across this
dread hillside. It was bitterly cold. The wind cut
with icy blast upon us from the precipices. Higher
still we climbed to where there was no vegetation,
nothing but scarped rocks and strange shaped and
strangely coloured mounds, reminding us of the
volcanic origin of the Andes.</p>

<p>Reaching another flat level we ran into the
mountain station of Zanjou Amarillo. Here were
engine sheds, for it is necessary to change the engine
at this place. We dismounted from the "cow-catcher,"
and, shivering with the cold, watched a
heavy black engine attached. From this point until
the other side of the Andes is reached part of the way
is covered by the use of a rack rail. The railway is
too steep for an ordinary engine to climb. Accordingly,
in the centre is a third line with cogs. The
engine has an extra wheel with cogs, so that it does
not run but grips its way to further heights.</p>

<p>The day was bright. Through clefts in our
shut-in way we could see snow on the mountains.
We travelled up a valley of desolation. We knew
that in the old days this was the main road from
Chili into Argentina, and in places we saw tumbled-down
shelter houses, now deserted, but of use in
former times when travellers crossed the mountains
by mule, for always they were provided with food
and fuel. There was something wonderfully fascinating,
crawling as it were to the roof of the world.
It was easy to understand how superstitious Indians
believed that evil spirits had their homes in the
inaccessible fastnesses. There was no living thing
to be seen anywhere except a couple of eagles.</p>

<p>Gradually the panorama opened. We got a
glimpse of the snow-covered heights in front of us.
Then the brightness of the day disappeared; the sun
was shrouded; there was a weird wail in the wind.
A snowstorm came upon us. Still the engine, with
something almost human in its determination, gripped
the cogs and pulled us higher and higher yet. It
was so cold we closed all windows and put on our
coats, and called for the attendant to bring us
beverages which we expected would produce warmth.</p>

<p>Midday arrived before we reached Puerta del
Inca, which was as far as we intended going. We
had our car detached, and waved our hands to
those on the express train, which soon disappeared
amid the rushing snow.</p>

<p>You may take it that the Incas never came to
this part of the world. That they did is a piece of
imagination. The so-called "Bridge of the Incas"
is a natural formation. A little river has eaten its
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
way through the hillside, and the tear and drip of
water during untold centuries has formed a great
natural arch. The water is volcanic and steamy,
and has mineral qualities which stain the rocks
with strange colourings.</p>

<p>Of course, the benefits of the waters for rheumatism,
and a score of other ailments, have been
exploited. Galleries have been built under the arch,
bath chambers cut above the rock, and water taken
in pipes into each, so that visitors may have a
"cure." In the summer time there are many visitors
to Puerta del Inca to gain benefit not only from
the waters, but from the mountain air, and to have
a pleasant time by excursions into the hills. There
is a commodious hotel.</p>

<p>In the winter time, when the snows are heavy,
two trains a week are run over to Chili. Sometimes
the snowfall is so severe that the traffic is completely
blocked, though with the construction of
snow-sheds, and fences to resist the drifting snow,
there is less danger than formerly. However, there
have been times when trains have been held up,
and passengers have had to stay for a week at Inca.
First-class passengers fend for themselves at the big
hotel; but down near the railway station there is
a great caravanserai of a place where poorer passengers
are provided with rough accommodation, and where
they can obtain food at cheap prices.</p>

<p>The snow had ceased, but there was a knife-like
wind whilst we battled up the hillside, making for
the hotel standing gaunt and solitary amongst the
barren mountains. We did not object to the little
discomfort. It was delightful to get into the warm
rooms, to sit down and have a meal, to smoke, to
chat, to play billiards, and some of us to have a
doze. Then, in the grey of the afternoon, with
occasional gleams of sunlight through the heavy
clouds which swathed the mountain tops, we
sauntered about this straggling, high perched
village.</p>

<p>There was no passenger train to Mendoza that
day. But we had arranged for an engine to take
charge of our car and run us back in the dark. So
at nightfall we climbed once more into the coach.
The stove was ablaze because the air was increasingly
cold. Trains only run along this mountain route in
the daylight, and so perhaps there was a little nervousness
in making the journey down through the valleys
in the blackness. In the front of the engine was a
great searchlight. So we went groaning and rocking,
with the whistle of the engine shrieking in the cañons,
on our way back to Mendoza. Once there was a
violent jerk when the engine was brought almost
to a standstill, for some cattle had strayed upon the
line and it was with difficulty they were frightened
off the track.</p>

<p>We were snug enough in our well-lit coach, where
before and after dinner the hours were wiled away
with games of cards. Occasionally we halted at
the tiny hamlets, and the residents ran out to have
a look at the unusual sight of an engine, with a huge
gleaming eye in front, picking its way, as it were,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
through the ravines, whilst behind was an illuminated
car with a party of merry Britishers.</p>

<p>Once I went on the little platform at the rear
of the coach. The whole world was wrapped in
blackness. After a time I got used to it. It was
possible to discern the ragged silhouettes of the
hilltops, and to peer into the cimmerian gloom of
the valley where the Mendoza River was hastening
noisily toward the plain. No wonder the natives
had a horror of these hills.</p>

<p>There was a kind of crunching clatter as the engine
ran over the stretch of the line with the cogged
third rail. When we reached less precipitous ground
the worst danger had passed, and the engine rattled
and bounced on her way. Down and down we sank
till at last, with a long-drawn scream from the engine,
we passed through the gates of the hills. We piled
more coal on the stove, and sat round smoking and
telling yarns, and wondered when we should all
have a similar trip again. It was one o'clock in the
morning when we got back to Mendoza.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

<h3>THE CAMP</h3>


<p>"To govern is to populate" is the maxim which
has guided the policy of the Argentine Government
ever since the first days of political emancipation.
The immense wealth of the fertile plains must remain
unappropriated just as long as there is insufficient
labour to sow and reap, to tend, to feed, and shear.</p>

<p>As a result of this policy the immigration organisation
of Argentina may now be regarded as the finest
in the world. Everything that could possibly be
done to bring a large number of useful emigrants to
the country has been done, with the result that
while in 1858 the number of immigrants was only
4,658 it increased until in 1913 it reached 300,000.
The increase has been steady except in 1888 and the
two following years, when the figures were 130,271,
218,744, and 77,815 respectively. These were years
in which an experiment was made with assisted
passages, and the result was that the supply of
immigrants jumped up and soon exceeded the demand.
The misery and poverty which followed the arrival
of the too numerous thousands caused a reaction.
Assisted passages were abandoned, and in 1891 the
number fell to 28,266. But since that date it has
risen steadily to its present height.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>The reason for the great preponderance of Italians
is that the climate is more suitable to them than to
those of any more northern nationality. Labour is
what is needed, and for hard manual work in an
almost tropical climate, quite unsuited to Englishmen,
Italians are not only fitted but expect considerably
less wages and a lower standard of comfort.
The best chances come to those who can speak
Spanish, and this the Italians learn somewhat more
quickly than the other immigrants.</p>

<p>Argentina is not a country for the casual Englishman
whose motives for leaving home are poverty
or a longing for adventure. He cannot work as a
labourer. Other positions where money can be earned
are few and difficult to obtain except by personal
influence. The Italians, too, are quiet and frugal in
their living&mdash;qualities which are not typical of the
English immigrant, and it is often remarked that an
Italian will thrive where an Englishman would starve.</p>

<p>Clerks and shop assistants, and those who can
only do office work, are not wanted at all. Farm
labourers, dairymen, and stockmen of practical experience
are welcomed, and there is a fair demand
for mechanics. Engine-drivers can get work if
they can speak Spanish, and Englishmen have been
found useful as butchers at the freezing works&mdash;but
that is not an occupation which will absorb
an unlimited number.</p>

<p>A considerable number of overseers are required
on <i>estancias</i>, but for these posts personal introduction
and previous practical experience are necessary. Disappointment
and chagrin await the young man who
arrives in the country with nothing except a large
amount of physical energy and high spirits, and
wishes at once to obtain a big salary on a ranch.
If these ignorant adventurers feel they must go to
that part of "abroad" their best way is to go on
a ranch as apprentice for some years at a nominal
salary. They will find the work hard, but the life
is not without its pleasures, and at the end of the
time they will probably be better qualified to take
up good positions. If such a one, in disgust at the
hardness and the monotony of the work, should
give up and should succeed in obtaining a place in a
bank or railway office, he will find himself better off
in money, but somewhat poorer in prospects than
he would be at home.</p>

<p>There is little chance of the immigrant securing
a small holding and forming a home. Even on
established farms good openings are not abundant.
The colonists are often short of capital, and not
long ago farming operations throughout an entire
district were almost stopped because the colonists
were unable to buy seed. The position was only
saved by the railway company providing the seed
on easy terms and without any security.</p>

<p>Among the more prosperous farmers are the
small Welsh colony founded at Chubut in 1865.
There are 400 of them, who are mostly doing very
well, and maintain in habits, language, and religion
the customs of their own country. In the Andes,
about 400 miles from Port Madryn, there is another
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
colony of about 500 Welsh people. One hears there
on a Sunday the sound of Welsh hymns from the
chapel.</p>

<p>When the immigrant, after his long train journey,
arrives at some station on the plains he finds that
the centre of life is the camp town. Whether he
comes from Italy or Spain, Syria or Bulgaria, he will
probably consider the camp towns are the ugliest
he has ever seen, unless he arrives at sunset, when
the glow and colour turn everything to beauty.
The roads are about as bad as roads can be. There
is no stone anywhere, and if holes are filled up it
is with earth which brings mud to mud and dust
to dust. When it is wet they are almost impassable
through depth of mud, and when it is dry the dust
is even worse&mdash;one can see the cloud of dust above
a town sometimes a dozen miles away.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the camp town&mdash;as distinct
from those in the cities&mdash;seem never to have developed
the idea of making it beautiful or even pleasant.
Extra buildings are run up just where and how the
owner likes. The prospect is marred everywhere by
the crude lines of galvanised iron roofs. The houses
are built along the uneven street in an irregularity
which has no charm. Refuse and dead dogs are
left lying about until someone specially affected, or
possibly the policeman, removes them a little farther
off. The houses are all one-storied, and have the
street frontage built up to look twice as high as
the house really is. In these small towns the inns&mdash;generally
at the corner of the street&mdash;are one-storied
also. The bar is a restaurant for the peons,
who in the evenings gather there to drink and gamble.
Inside is a more private eating-room, and beyond
this the yard round which are the bedrooms. The
sanitary arrangements leave much to be desired,
and there is everywhere the strong odour of garlic.</p>

<p>The most characteristic figure of the camp town
is the gaucho. He is the native of the plains, and
is usually of mixed blood. The idle, independent,
nomad gauchos are almost an extinct class. In the
early days they refused to settle anywhere, or do
any regular work. They were horsemen and hunters,
and roamed over the plains, staying here and there
in ramshackle huts till restlessness, or the owner of
the land, moved them on. They were the gipsies
of the Argentine. Whenever there was a war or a
revolution the gaucho would be found in the vanguard,
and in times of peace he would enliven the
dullness with private feuds which did not end with
words.</p>

<p>But civilisation has been too strong for him, and
the modern gaucho is a more law-abiding and useful
person. He still wears his old, picturesque costume,
the broad sombrero, the shirt, and wide Turkish
trousers, which may be of any colour in the spectrum,
tucked into his boots. In cold weather he wears
over his shoulders the poncho, a blanket which has
as many varieties of hue as his trousers. His saddle
is ornamented with silver, and he has fancy stirrups
and jingling spurs. But the chief part of his equipment
is the big knife&mdash;often a foot long, and usually
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
of fancy pattern&mdash;stuck in his belt. This is used
freely for defensive purposes, or to avenge some
real or imaginary insult; it also serves when eating
his lunch.</p>

<p>In spite of his rough appearance and manner,
the gaucho is often kind-hearted. He is, however,
quarrelsome in his cups, and has all the native
capacity for fancying an insult and much tenacity
in revenge. Much of his spare time is spent in
gambling, and any money he does not lose in this
way he spends in drink or extravagant and useless
purchases.</p>

<p>At the heart of the camp town stands the camp
store, and the gauchos will always be found near
it. It is the post office, the exchange, the rendezvous.
Under its roof are formed and discussed the
ideas that count in local self-government. Business
is transacted with a delightful absence of hustle.
All the slowness of Spanish courtesy is added to
the deliberation of the dweller in wide solitudes.
The result is an unhurrying way of buying and
selling which would make a Smithfield salesman
white with despair.</p>

<p>The gauchos are responsible for the chief amusement
of the camp town&mdash;other than drinking and
gambling&mdash;for it is they who organise the horse-races.
These primitive meetings are not quite so
frequent as they used to be, but they still take place
on many Sundays and holidays, and for them the
gaucho makes preparations such as he cannot be
stirred to at any other time. He gets a new suit of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
clothes, cleans and polishes the saddle and bridle
of his horse, puts round his neck a silk scarf of
gorgeous design, and has an unwonted show of silver
both on his horse and himself. Only on horseback
is the gaucho thoroughly at home, and on these days
he looks his best. There is no finesse about the
racing; it is a test of sheer endurance of man and
animal, and when the race is over both are exhausted.
The handicapping has none of the careful
science of Newmarket. When the best horse is in
full course, running as fast as it can be urged, the
handicapper catches one of his hind feet in a lasso
and gives a quick jerk so that horse and rider are
flung heavily to the ground. This, as may be
imagined, gives the second horse a very fair chance
of equalising a disadvantage in pace or staying
power. Although the riders are perfect horsemen,
there is little attraction for the European spectator
in such a wild ordeal to man and animal. The
prizes are usually a saddle, a bridle, a suit of clothes,
or even a piece of beef of ample size and unusual
quality. The gaucho, it may be mentioned, is very
fond of beef, which he roasts with the hide on.</p>

<p>The duties of the gaucho are to look after the
stock on the ranch, chiefly in connection with the
"rodeo," or mustering of the cattle. Mounted on
horseback, the gaucho drives the animals to the
meeting-place. The herds are never allowed to
stand still, but even at the end of their journey are
kept moving in a sort of rough circle so that the
chance of panic and stampede is minimised. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
cattle are counted by driving them in ones or twos
through a narrow line, a task requiring considerable
activity&mdash;especially when the herd, after being
counted, has to be divided into two or three lots&mdash;if
a stampede is to be prevented.</p>

<p>Perhaps the only fear in the gaucho's life is that
he may take anthrax from the cattle, for should he
do so, and the wound be not cut or burnt out by
the third day, his chance of recovery is slight.</p>

<p>With the changes that have come over the
<i>estancias</i> during the last twenty-five years&mdash;fenced
fields of alfalfa appearing where formerly there
was nothing but the open plain&mdash;the days of unrestricted
gallop over the prairie are over. The rider
now passes through an endless series of enclosures,
through gate after gate. The law of trespass, formerly
unknown, may even prevent him from approaching
the lagunas. Barbed wire, too, has been introduced;
but though injuries sometimes occur, the
cattle seem to have learned to keep clear of it.</p>

<p>In the house itself the change is as remarkable.
The old cramped quarters and ugly furniture have
given place to more rooms, better furnished, and
pictures, pianos, and books are not at all uncommon.
Fruit and flower gardens have been laid
out. Sometimes on a large ranch a dairy is found;
there is a blacksmith's and carpenter's shop, and
gardeners and book-keepers are kept. Better accommodation
is also provided for the peons. Still,
generally speaking, these are the exceptions.</p>

<p>Around the ranches of Britishers there are many
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 2315]</a></span>
signs of national individuality&mdash;a tennis court,
cricket grounds, even a golf course. Pheasants and
rabbits are sometimes reared so that the exile may
not be without a chance of shooting such as he
would enjoy at home.</p>

<p>The houses themselves are not costly structures.
Some are of the soft, dark red Argentine brick,
which mellows rapidly, and in a few years looks as
picturesque and soft-toned as English brick does
after a century or so.</p>

<p>The houses of the colonists are mostly built of
mud. The new colonist, when given his unprepared
land, does not trouble to build anything but the
simplest of dwellings. Boards are built up so as
to leave a narrow oblong space of the same shape
as the outer walls of the house are to be, and in this
is placed mud mixed with straw. When this has
dried the boards are removed, and the four walls
of the required height are left standing. Spaces for
windows and doors are then cut out, a thatched roof
is put on, and, without much further elaboration,
the tenants put in the furniture and begin life in
their new home. Sometimes the walls are made of
mud bricks.</p>

<p>A curious feature of the camp are the large carts,
with wheels 8 feet high, on which the wheat is taken
from the camp to the railway station. They are
drawn by oxen, ten or twelve being required for
each cart, which will carry several tons. As the
axles are never greased the noise made by these
carts is frightful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>Labour, especially at harvest time, is scarce, for
owing to the lack of granaries and elevators the grain
must be gathered and threshed quickly, and though
the latest reaping machines are, of course, used,
the best of them require much auxiliary labour.
Even in the busy harvest time, however, the midday
siesta for everyone in the camp is not omitted,
as the sun is extremely hot for two or three hours
about noon.</p>

<p>The huge flocks of sheep, varying in size from
12,000 to 80,000, are mostly owned by New Zealand
ranchers who have settled in Argentina in recent
years. They are shepherded on the open pampas
by gauchos on horseback, whose chief duty is to
keep the flocks apart, and so prevent confusion of
ownership or the spread of contagious diseases.
Formerly the mutton was burnt as fuel, only the
wool, tallow, and skins being sold; but since the
advent of cold storage it has been exported. The
wool is not washed before sale, and therefore fetches
a low price. The shearing, which used to be done
by hand, is now nearly all done by machinery.
Travelling from ranch to ranch each shearer deals,
on the average, with about a hundred sheep a day.</p>

<p>There is one farm where a flock of about 13,000
Lincoln ewes are milked in dairies, and a considerable
profit made. The milk is made into cheese,
which finds a ready sale. It is only in exceptionally
rich pastures that this is done, and the utmost
care is taken that the lamb does not suffer from
the deprivation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most important changes of recent
years has been the introduction of windmills for
pumping water. In the absence of rivers and lakes
a well worked by hand was used in the old days
to draw water for the house, while the cattle would
drink at the shallow lagunas in the hollows of the
plain. But as the best land is higher up wells and
troughs had to be made. First there was the
"jaguel," worked by a horse and rider. Next came
an arrangement of buckets on an endless chain,
which brought up water and emptied it into the
troughs or reservoirs. This was the "noria," and
was worked by a horse or mule. But when the
water level began to fall&mdash;some say through the
introduction of alfalfa&mdash;and the lagunas to dry up,
it was found necessary to dig deeper wells, and to
adopt the use of semi-artesian wells. The water,
which often is saline, is specially so when drawn
from these semi-artesian wells.</p>

<p>The great scourge which the camp has to fight,
as already shown, is the swarms of locusts which
have come down annually from the north since
1905. Previous to that there had been freedom
from this pest for five years. The invasion usually
begins in October, when a few flying locusts may
be seen. In a day or two they are arriving in millions,
and at the worst are so numerous that they form a
cloud over the face of the sun, and make a shadow
beneath them. The principal damage is done by
what is left behind by the locusts&mdash;for millions upon
millions of eggs are deposited in the ground. In
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
about six weeks the young are hatched. They cannot
fly, but jump like grasshoppers, which, indeed,
they very much resemble, except for their bright
colouring&mdash;red and yellow, black and green. They
move in swarms from stem to stem, and every fragment
of green leaf disappears before their devouring
energy. After they have visited a cornfield
nothing is left but naked stalks. Six weeks later
they develop wings, and swarms of them begin to
fly across the sky like clouds or smoke from some
great conflagration. They will alight in such heaps
on a railway track that they sometimes stop a train.</p>

<p>Reference has already been made to the way in
which the Government assists the landowners to
fight this plague. Under penalty of a fine every
landowner must maintain men to fight the locusts.
But even if it were possible to exterminate all those
on one estate, they might arrive in equal numbers
from adjoining land, and a million are not missed
from a thousand million. Unanimous action alone
would be effective, and this the Government are trying
to bring about. Meanwhile, a commission has
been appointed to deal with the subject. It is
probable that if the northern source from which they
come could be found the country could rid itself
of the trouble within a few years.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

<h3>A MIXED GRILL</h3>


<p>In the hot months, December, January, and February,
it is the proper thing to move to Mar del Plata.
There the rich Argentines disport themselves with
the gorgeousness of the Russians at Yalta in September.
If the ladies do not bathe in pearl necklaces
they wear exquisite "creations"; and propriety
insists that the men must wear a costume
which is a cross between a frock coat and a suit of
pyjamas. The Parisian houses have their representatives
in the Republic, and an Argentine lady
who does not change expensive dresses five times
a day is out of the fun. There is gold and gambling
and dancing at the most elaborate, though not the
gayest&mdash;for the Argentine is not gay&mdash;seaside resort
in the world. As for the "tango" dance, no respectable
Argentine ever dances it. I have seen it
performed in tempestuous manner amongst those
who do not mind whether they are considered respectable
or not&mdash;a very different thing from the
milk-and-water efforts in London ballrooms.</p>

<p>It is not quite decided whether the phrase "filthy
lucre" comes from the United States or from Argentina.
There is only one dirtier thing in the world
than the American dollar note, and that is the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
Argentine peso; but in extenuation of its filth one
has to remember it is less than half the dollar's
value. I am convinced that one of the reasons
money is held in small regard in the Argentine is
that nobody can have any respect for a worn,
tattered, and evil-smelling piece of paper, even
though its equivalent be a shilling and eightpence.
I never appreciated the genuine value of money
till I changed a bilious and decrepit ten peso note
for half-crowns, shillings, and threepenny bits. Of
course, the Argentines have no money but paper
and nickel, though you are assured there are untold
millions of gold in the cellars of the national casa.
But you never strike anything but paper. When I
drew English gold from the bank for use on my
voyage home, and swaggeringly emptied an envelope
of sovereigns on the table at a luncheon party given
by the British Minister, my lady neighbour gave a
little shriek of delight at the blessed spectacle of a
real English sovereign. The only coin which holds
good the world round is the British sovereign.</p>

<p>Now of the cosmopolitan throng exploiting the
resources of Argentina it has been left to the Jews
to work on distinctive racial lines. The Hebrew
population numbers 40,000, a community founded
and fostered according to well-defined plans which
not only ensure the comfort and well-being of the
thrifty, but mark a revival of agriculture as one of
the industrial arts of the Jews.</p>

<p>Centuries of wandering, of persecution and oppression,
of lethargic waiting for the "return to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
promised land," divorced the Hebrew from his
original position as an agriculturist. In the Argentine
he is beginning to rehabilitate himself. Backed
by the Jewish Colonisation Association, and aided
by that commercial talent which has become characteristic
of the Jew wherever he may be, the Jewish
farmer in South America represents a new type in
the great Israelitish family.</p>

<p>What more natural than that the Argentine
should be regarded as one of the likely homes for
the wandering tribes by those who for years have
promoted the Jewish settlement movements? Jewish
patriarchs and philanthropists looked longingly at
the map of South America in search of a goal for
racial and religious aspirations. The oppression and
persecution of co-religionists in Russia and Roumania
in the early 'nineties called for action as well as
ideals. Shelter had to be found where thrift and
enterprise were offered their due reward. Argentina
was fixed upon, and the foundation of to-day's well
organised scheme was inaugurated through the
munificence of the late Baron Hirsch. Under his
last will and testament the financial stability of the
colonisation scheme was secured.</p>

<p>A society representative of Israelites in Berlin,
London, Frankfort, Paris, and Brussels, as well as
the Anglo-Jewish and other Hebrew associations,
was formed under English jurisdiction. Only the
interest of the fund left by the baron may be spent
in assisting Jewish colonists to the ownership of
their farms, and the tiding over of the inevitable
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
depressions in agriculture. Every two months the
executive of this society meets in Paris and considers
the destinies of Jewish colonists not only in
the Argentine, but in the United States, Canada,
Asia Minor, Palestine, Brazil, and Russia.</p>

<p>The memory of Baron Hirsch is perpetuated in
Argentina by the prosperous colony bearing his
name in the province of Buenos Aires. Altogether
the Jewish Colonisation Society owns some 250 leagues
of land in the country. The property in the Baron
Hirsch Colony alone covers 44 square leagues, and
is served by three important stations.</p>

<p>In many respects the colonisation of the Jews in
the Republic sets an example in thoroughness that
might well be copied. The main purpose of the
scheme&mdash;to succour the oppressed&mdash;is carried out
without prejudicing the financial security of the society.
Houses are provided in each of the Jewish colonies
for the new immigrant, and here the family is cared
for till work on one of the farms has been found for
the father. Only those who have fled from oppression
are granted the financial assistance of the Colonisation
Society in establishing their own independence.
Jews from Germany and Great Britain are not granted
holdings by the society. The probable explanation
of this rule is that the English or German emigrant
arrives forearmed, and is financially equipped for
colonial enterprise before leaving these free countries.</p>

<br /><br />


<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>

<p>The applicant for a holding, roughly 350 acres,
must first of all have had two years' residence in the
country, and show that he has had practical experience
in farm work. His application is sent to Buenos
Aires, where the interests of the Jewish Colonisation
Society in the Argentine are watched by a permanent
administration. From there a report is forwarded
to the international executive in Paris before
the land is finally allotted to the applicant. The
rest follows the ideals of those who are working at
the rural and agricultural problems in Great Britain.
At practically cost price the land is sold to the new
tenant farmer. The rate of interest charged by the
society is 4 per cent. Twenty years for repayment
of the capital is fixed as a minimum as well as a
maximum period. However successful the farmer
may be, he is not allowed to receive the title deeds
of his allotment until twenty years have elapsed.
The value of this precaution has often been proved.
For one thing, it hinders any tendency to traffic
in the land and to raise mortgages on the slightest
provocation. The successful tenant can always find
use for his year's surplus in developing and improving
the estate which is one day to be his own. On the
other hand, the rapid increase in land values leaves
the society on the safe side should the tenant purchaser
be unfortunate or lacking in enterprise.
Apart from the land, the society advances the tenant
3,000 dollars in the form of horses, machinery, and
equipment. In the event of the farmer failing to
make his way, the society only stands to lose a year
or two's interest on the capital outlay. And the
natural increase in the value of the land, as I have
before shown, is sufficient to cover any such deficit.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
A variation of these conditions operates in the
Baron Hirsch Colony. Here, instead of being
advanced the value of 3,000 dollars, the applicant
for a farm has to prove possession of such a sum
before he is qualified to take over an allotment.</p>

<p>With wise foresight the Jewish colonies have been
set up in various parts of the Republic. This prevents
the scheme from being dedicated to one class
of agriculture, and enables the colonist to try his
hand, say, at cattle rearing if crop-raising does not
prove to his liking. In the northern colonies the
industry is chiefly in cattle, corn, and olive growing,
while in the south the cultivation is chiefly in wheat,
rye, and oats.</p>

<p>A good year sees the industrious farmer with a
surplus of anything from 10,000 to 20,000 dollars
(Argentine). Should bad weather or working misfortunes
turn the account the other way he has only
to apply to the administration in Buenos Aires, and
the money advanced is simply added to the purchase
price of his holding.</p>

<p>On the whole the Jewish colonists are thrifty
and prosperous. They have their own co-operative
societies for the purchase of necessities and the distribution
of their products; they have their sick
funds and local hospitals; religious freedom has
enabled them to establish their own tabernacles and
to observe the Jewish feasts. They have set a
splendid example in citizenship to their neighbouring
colonists. In the Argentine, perhaps more than
elsewhere, the Jews are on the high road to a restoration
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
of their ancient virility, and are best
fulfilling their destiny as a great race.</p>

<p>With the exception of the Welsh settlements
already alluded to, the Jews stand alone as colonists
on purely racial lines. The effectiveness of their
organisation is the measure of their contentment
and prosperity. We have the contrast in the case
of other immigrants. Many of them are captured by
the political agitator. They are taught to see in revolt
and industrial uprising the short cut to affluence
and ease. Strikes are frequent, discontent is sown,
and time is devoted to attacks upon authority which
might be better employed in individual effort.
Politics are so inseparable from the daily affairs of
the country that discontent in the main becomes
wholly political. Its manifestations have no bearing
upon the social and commercial possibilities of
the Argentine. With wise and tolerant government
on the one hand, and patience and perseverance
on the other, much of the friction that now arises
would disappear.</p>

<p>For it has to be admitted that some of the attacks
upon the bureaucracy are not altogether inexcusable.
With the influence of officialdom forcing itself upon
every interest of the working classes, the inevitable
increase in the cost of living, and the instances of
bureaucratic tyranny frequently brought to light, it
is not to be wondered that the unorganised labourer
adopts the exaggerated point of view of the agitator,
and sees in revolution alone the pathway to reform.</p>

<p>In Buenos Aires, for example, the cost of living
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
is greater than elsewhere, though the scale of wages
is also higher. Imported goods are dear, rent high,
efficient labour scarce, and municipal rates heavy.
The result is that even the highly paid worker finds
himself with only a moderate balance when all
charges are met.</p>

<p>With the agriculturist things are not so bad. He
can produce for himself most of the necessaries of
life, and can avoid many of the burdens of the townsman
in the way of expensive clothing and other
imported luxuries. Strange as it may appear in a
country supplying most of the world's markets, meat
in Buenos Aires is nearly as dear as in England.
The same applies to many other commodities produced
or producible in the country. A comparative
list shows few things cheaper in the Argentine than
in the Old World.</p>

<p>The cost of the breakfast table might be reduced
considerably if more trouble were taken with what
one might describe as the by-products of agriculture.
The people are invariably out for the big deal in
cattle or corn. Insufficient attention is paid to
dairy-farming, poultry rearing, gardening, fruit-growing,
and the production of those little comforts
that are now part and parcel of agriculture in
England and France. The cultivator's first and, in
the majority of cases, only thought is the land and
its direct yield. With the same opportunities many
an English small-holder would make a quick fortune
in Argentina. In this oversight the Argentine has
gone the way of most new countries. The question
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 343]</a></span>
of "agricultural smalls," however, as I have shown,
is now being considered in conjunction with the
increased cost of living.</p>

<p>Labour is so scarce in some parts that the introduction
of Chinese or Japanese colonists has been
suggested. Such a step, however, would arouse as
fierce a criticism as did the introduction of Chinese
coolies on the South African Rand mines. They were
tried in Chili, and are by no means liked. The
lumber trade of Posados still requires thousands of
workers. The natives cannot be kept at work to
any extent, and to meet the demand Russians, Poles,
and Finns have been brought over in thousands.
Timber for railway sleepers is the principal product.
Each year some two million logs are sent down the
Parana River to be used in railway construction at
home and abroad.</p>

<p>The lessons of the great coal strike in England
during 1912 were quickly grasped by the Government
of Argentina. Like other countries depending
upon Great Britain for coal supplies, Argentina had
to consider the disastrous consequences of any disorganisation
of her transport service. Substitutes
for coal fuel had to be counted. The crisis of this
period proved a blessing in disguise. Government
attention was directed towards the discovery of oil
in widely separated districts of the Republic. A
law has now been passed reserving to the Government
12,500 acres of the petroleum zone of Comodora
Rivadavia, and prohibiting the issue of any mining
or proprietary rights. To displace coal, Argentina
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
would require 2,000,000 tons of oil fuel and about
150 wells. A start has been made in the south,
where fresh wells are being sunk at Comodora
Rivadavia. Five wells produced 18,000 tons of
petroleum in a year of experiment. In 1913 it
rose to 28,000 tons. When the Argentine can turn
its attention from the sources of wealth now being
tapped, who knows what will follow the enterprise
in oil? But nothing has been found which would
warrant a "boom" in Argentine oil.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, an annual increase of 1,000,000 tons
in the shipping trade of Buenos Aires has left Argentina,
like Oliver Twist, asking for more. The cattle-breeding
industry responds to each stimulus given
by the provision of more refrigerating vessels. The
supply of meat is always greater than the means of
distribution. Already America is looking to the
Argentine for meat to augment her own supplies.
It is the only country to which she can turn with
confidence. Other parts of the world have for years
been fed from here. The dependence of the outer
world upon the meat and cereals of Argentina almost
suggests that the country was pre-ordained to be the
larder of the human family.</p>

<p>For the hunter and traveller, Argentina and its
bordering lands have their full share of attractions.
The plains and mountains of the Andean land are
the haunts of the jaguar, puma, wild cat, and various
breeds of wild deer. Its birds include the vulture,
hawk, albatross, penguin, snipe, bustard, partridges
of several kinds, as well as singing birds in great
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
variety. In fact, many of the birds of the mountain
and forest are still unclassified, and are the study of
ornithologists and naturalists from all parts of the
world. The martinetta, a big grouse, brings into
sport something of a novelty. It is slow to fly,
and is often caught by snares into which it is driven.
For variation, however, it is forced to take wing
by means of a rope dragged by riders across the
path. The rope pulls the martinetta off its feet.
As soon as it flies the third huntsman behind the
rope fires. Three are necessary to form a party,
and the turn with the gun is arranged.</p>

<p>A peculiar type of llama is found in these parts.
In shape the long neck and head resemble those of
the giraffe and camel respectively. The body is
like that of a donkey and the legs are as graceful
as those of a deer. Their voracity makes them
unpopular with sheep breeders, except for the value
of their skins, for it has been estimated that one
guanaco&mdash;as they are called&mdash;will eat as much grass
as nine sheep. The beautiful humming bird is found
in parts of the Argentine as well as in the Andes.
Many of the vultures are also to be seen. The
condor is a bird of such immense size as to be worthy
of special mention. From wing to wing it measures
9 feet. To hatch its eggs it seeks the remote crags
of the Andes, and has been found at an altitude of
20,000 feet.</p>

<p>In Patagonia we are able to revive memories of
the schoolroom, and to see how far juvenile fancy
has exaggerated the stature of what the teacher said
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
were the biggest men in the world. Their actual
height is from 5 feet 10 inches to 6 feet 4 inches,
but their stature is rendered more impressive on
account of their huge arms and massive chests. As
the name implies, and as the school-reader reminded
us, the Patagonians have huge flat feet. Their
adoption of such civilised habiliments as boots would
mean a revolution in the standards of the boot-making
industry. Among travellers the Patagonian
has a good reputation for honesty, amiability, and
kindness to his womenfolk. The people have no
idols, but believe in witchcraft.</p>

<p>Patagonia is almost virgin land, and Santa Cruz
is, perhaps, the most dreary region of the country.
It is considered, however, to have a future, and
some promising settlements have already been
established. The Patagonian pastures have not as
yet been bothered about by Argentines, because they
are still wanting more workers to develop the enormous
northern areas.</p>

<p>The force of the alliance between good government
and good health is ever present to the traveller in
South America. The continent has witnessed the
greatest ravages of leprosy. It is significant that the
greater number of lepers are found where governments
are unstable and administration uncertain.
In Chili and Argentina, where government is something
more than a symbol, lepers are relatively few,
and are practically disappearing. Farther north the
position is worse, and again there comes the analogy
between bad government and disease. Venezuela,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
Colombo, and Ecuador, where the life of no government
is certain for above twenty-four hours, are
among the worst areas of leprosy. Complete segregation
is the only effective method of coping with
the disease. This can only be accomplished with
firm and effective administration.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

<h3>TUCUMAN AND THE SUGAR INDUSTRY</h3>


<p>It was my good fortune to visit Tucuman in the
northern area of Argentina during the height of the
sugar-cane harvest. Here one was about as near the
centre of South America as could be desired. The
vegetation was wildly luxuriant, and seemed to have
lapped over into Argentina from the jungles of Brazil.
Here, also, the Latin colonists seemed to have been
left behind, and one ran into a strangely mixed
people, mostly native Indian in origin, but with a
tincture in their veins from the Spanish settlers of
centuries ago, together with a subsequent negro
admixture.</p>

<p>I had looked forward to visiting a tropical town,
of long streets of mud shanties heavily thatched,
and with innumerable palm trees waving their plumes
overhead. This kind of thing was to be found in
the suburbs, where the Spanish-negro-Indians wore
big, rough-made, straw-plaited hats, and their dusky
mates, in bright garments, gossipped in the shadows,
whilst their prolific offspring&mdash;often stark naked&mdash;gambolled
in the sand. But Tucuman itself is much
like other Argentine towns, for it has its plaza and
statues and public gardens, its imposing houses and
hotels and restaurants, its tramcars and electric light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>Tucuman has played its part in the history of
the Republic. It was here that Independence was
proclaimed in 1810, when the overlordship of Spain
was repudiated; and it was here that, after much
fighting, the treaty of peace was signed on July 9th,
1816. The house in which this took place was a
modest building, not much bigger than a cottage.
Sentiment prevented it being swept away before
the rush for improvement, and so it has been left
standing. But about it has been erected an imposing
structure. Here is a house within a house; and
a stout dame conducts the visitor into a gaunt room
where Argentina's first parliament assembled; where
there are paintings of fierce-eyed national heroes,
frescoes depicting the proclamation of Independence,
the chair where the first president of the
Republic sat, and in which the visitor is invited to
sit; and there is the customary visitors' book to
be signed.</p>

<p>Tucuman vies with Cordoba in having amongst
its residents some of the real old Spanish aristocracy
of Argentina. Indeed, Tucuman puts forth the claim
that it has the most beautiful women in South
America. Certainly at the hour of promenade, when
the sun begins to dip and before nightfall comes
swiftly, and the people take to walking amongst
the orange trees in the Plaza, or sauntering along
the main thoroughfares inspecting the attractions
in the shop windows, there is no difficulty in imagining
that this is a bit of Madrid instead of being a
little-visited town tucked away in the north of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
Argentina. Several enthusiastic residents assured
me that their ladies were as close to the fashions
as Paris itself. I am no authority on these matters;
but I can say that the womenfolk appeared as well
garbed as they are in the capitals of Europe. Along
the clean streets whizzed expensive motor-cars.
Before the restaurants were the little round marble-topped
tables with which most of us are acquainted
in European cities; and here men sat and drank
their amer piquant and puffed their cigarettes, whilst
the band played music, ragtime and other, with
which we are so familiar at home.</p>

<p>The main avenue, still in the making, promises
to be a gorgeous thoroughfare one of these days.
There is a casino, a theatre (the Odeon), a palace
for the bishop, barracks, a hospital, a brewery which
cost £250,000 to build, and a "Savoy Hotel," where
there was on sale whisky "as drunk in the House
of Lords," and where one's admiration was only
checked by finding the telephone system defective.</p>

<p>Tucuman is the centre of the sugar-growing industry.
For many miles around the country is
covered with sugar plantations, and the railway
companies have little belt lines running through the
cultivated area to facilitate the gathering of the
crop. When I was there in 1913 the harvest had
been the most prolific within knowledge. In places
the line was blocked with wagons piled high with
the cane, whilst in several quarters I heard grumbling
that there was not a sufficiency of trucks to cope
with the trade.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>

<p>One day, accompanied by several friends, I made
an extensive motor-car trip to the sugar plantations.
As soon as we got beyond the town, and upon the
broad road which stretched as far as eye could reach
until it was lost in the shimmer of sunshine, we
experienced the inconvenience of a bad way. With
all its excellences, Argentina, as I have before remarked,
has as bad roads as you will find in the
world. There had been no rain for months, and
our route was across miles of powdery earth. We
sank into it almost to the axle. We churned up
dust so that soon we were smothered in it. Our
faces were almost as grimy as though we had been
in a coalpit. Gaucho horsemen pranced past us in
clouds of dust. When we overtook an ox-drawn
wagon it was like pushing through a fog of dust.
On either side the vegetation was profuse and rank,
and the terrific heat of the tropics filled the air
with a strong, nauseating aroma.</p>

<p>When we were in the sugar-cane district we saw
hundreds of tawny-skinned men cutting the cane.
Armed with an instrument which seemed to be half
knife and half butcher's chopper, the peon seized
the top of a cane, cut it off near the root, gave it
a swing in the air, and with rapid slashes removed
the protruding leaves, and then pitched the stalk
on one side, where a heap was lying to be gathered
by women and children and carried to the waiting
wagons.</p>

<p>Twice we halted to watch the dexterity of the
cutters and to visit the mud huts. These were
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
picturesque but not pretty. They looked like disreputable
brick-kilns, and although possessed of a
door, were deficient in windows. The interior was
dark, but most of the family spend their time out
of doors under the trees, where they have their fires
and prepare maté, the native tea, which is served
in a shell and sucked through a tube. Whenever
the natives have nothing else to do you are sure
to find them drinking maté.</p>

<p>Around Tucuman are twenty-five sugar mills,
and it is reckoned they produce 200,000 tons of
sugar, of which between 60,000 and 70,000 tons
are exported. We went to the fine mills at San
Pablo belonging to Nouges Brothers, and the senior
partner was good enough to show me over the place,
so that I could inspect the whole process, from the
arrival of the cane until the sugar is loaded in sacks
ready to be sent to Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>The stalks, as high as a man, are thrown into a
machine which literally chews them up. As they
pass through heavy rollers they crunch and crack,
and yield their juice which runs in a nasty brown
fluid into a trough. Again the mashed-up cane is
subjected to further squeezings between rollers, until
practically the last drop of the syrup is squeezed
out. The treacle-like stuff is run into big basins
beneath which furnaces are blazing, and is kept at
a simmer until the sugar reaches the consistency of
dough. After that it is sluiced into highly heated
steel cups, which are constantly whirling.</p>

<p>It is interesting to stand by in the sickly-sweet
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
atmosphere and watch how, in the constant spinning
and evaporation from the heat, the stuff loses much
of its brown appearance and becomes, when thoroughly
dried, like the cheap brown sugar as we know it at
home. It is further refined in other hot chambers
until it is quite white. Then men with sacks catch
the stream of sugar as it rushes from the mouth of
the refinery. Much of it is spilt, and the men are
up to their boots in sugar. But the bags are quickly
filled, pushed on one side, sewn up, hastened on
lorries to waiting carts, which, when loaded, convey
the freight to the railway wagons close by. Señor
Nouges told me that at that time his firm was turning
out 175 tons of sugar a day.</p>

<p>The sugar-cane must have plenty of sun and
water. The rivers I saw during harvest time were
miserable, shallow streams, meandering their way
through what looked like a broad boulder-strewn
bed of what once had been a wide stream. I was
there, however, in the dry season, but was told that
in the rainy season these streams are increased a
thousandfold in volume, are frequently a quarter
of a mile wide, and, when the torrents are heavy,
overflow their banks and inundate the land. Irrigation
is carried to a high point, so that in times of
flood the waters of the rivers can be conveyed many
miles and utilised in providing moisture to the cane.</p>

<p>It has only been in comparatively recent years
that the possibilities of the extensive region of North
Argentina, of which Tucuman is the centre, in regard
to sugar have been realised. There is the initial
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
expense of clearing the ground of jungle, and providing
irrigation. Once, however, this has been
done, and the cane planted, a paying crop is obtained
the first year. The same roots grow useful stalks
for three or four years, and then comes the process
of gradually planting new roots and removing the
old ones so that the same soil can be made productive.
Weeds are numerous, and in the early months of
growth these have to be constantly removed, first
of all to prevent their smothering the young shoots,
and secondly to give the cane all the nutriment there
is in the soil. There is also the danger of invasion
by locusts, and the occasional possibility in the cold
months&mdash;say about May and June&mdash;of frost doing
injury to the saplings. Allowing, however, for these
disadvantages, the advance in the sugar industry in
Argentina during the last dozen years has been
nothing short of amazing. Still, I could not help
feeling that the industry is only in its infancy. As
soon as the foreigner appreciates what northern
Argentina can do&mdash;at present most of the sugar
growing is in the hands of Spanish-Argentines&mdash;there
will certainly be enormous development. One
of the things which will appeal to the foreign
capitalist who takes up sugar growing on an extensive
scale is that there is a quick return on the money
invested in development.</p>

<p>Though Tucuman is the capital of the sugar growing
interest, it may be said there are plenty of areas
equally favourable for raising the cane. Sugar
growing at Tucuman began about thirty years ago,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
long before the railway ever reached the place, and
to meet purely local demands; because in those
days the transport of imported sugar, as of other
goods, by cart was expensive. When the railway put
Tucuman into near communication with other parts
of the Republic, the possibilities of a great trade
were at once recognised. Tucuman sugar, however,
could not in those days compete, either in quality or
price, with that which came from other countries.
It was, therefore, decided to give encouragement to
Argentine sugar growing by a tariff on sugar which
came from across sea. As one who favours the
saving of a struggling industry in a home country
from being strangled by vigorous foreign competition,
I believe this was the right thing to do. Sugar
growing bounded ahead. Not many years elapsed
before the sugar growers became a powerful combination,
with much influence on the Government.
The result was that, whilst at the start the duty on
imported sugar was small, it was gradually increased
until it became prohibitive. Therefore at the present
time very little foreign sugar comes into the country,
and the Argentine industry has gone ahead in a
remarkable manner.</p>

<p>Mr. N. L. Watson, in his publication "The
Argentine as a Market," describes how Tucuman
became a veritable El Dorado. Two years sufficed
to give a net return four times as great as the
capital invested. As a natural consequence, labour
and capital flowed into the sugar districts.
Lawyers deserted their professions, workmen their
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
tools, to throw themselves with a regular fever into
an occupation so full of promise. Works sprang up
as if by magic, palaces were constructed to house the
staffs, capital was lavished on the industry by
individuals and banking houses alike. While fortunes
were being created in the cultivation of the sugar-cane,
orchards, orange crops, pasturage, and arable
land were being either transformed or neglected.</p>

<p>Something like a trust has been formed amongst
the sugar growers, with the object of maintaining
prices. But public opinion is becoming so pronounced
that, whilst there is no disposition to let the foreigner
come in and undersell the native production, the
tariff should be reduced in order that there may
be more competition between the native and outside
growers, with a slight advantage always given
to the Argentine grower. The Republic is quite
capable of growing all the sugar its inhabitants may
require; but fair competition from the sugar of
other countries will do much to regulate prices.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

<h3>THE INDUSTRIAL SIDE OF THE REPUBLIC</h3>


<p>The main energies of Argentina must for some time
be devoted to her most obvious source of wealth.
Yet it would be unwise to neglect a consideration of
her industrial possibilities. Naturally she is anxious
to supply herself with the commodities essential to
daily life and comfort. But up to the present the
Argentine has relied chiefly upon the exchange of
its products, even for commodities which might be
produced at home. This is due to the tendency
common to new countries of going in for the "big
deal." In this sense the agricultural industry has
still a long journey to go. Intensive culture has so
far not become a necessity. Extensive culture has
yielded such good profits that no impulse has been
given to the full exploitation of Argentina's hidden
resources. This partly explains why the casual
observer is confronted with the apparent anomaly
of vegetables, fruit, eggs, and other foodstuffs being
dear in an agricultural country.</p>

<p>It is on the lines of finishing her existing industries,
attending to by-products as well as main products,
that the foundations of Argentina's industrial
future will best be laid. The immediate obstacle is
the scarcity of labour. The essential requirements
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
already exist, a good climate, excellent means of
communication, a growing population, an open
Custom House for most of the machinery and implements
required for national industries, and a stable
credit.</p>

<p>Few countries have been able to inaugurate home
industries under more favourable auspices. Nothing
can deprive Argentina of her agricultural eminence.
But how she will fare when embarking upon the
more uncertain career of a home manufacturer depends
upon many things. Necessity is already driving
Argentina seriously to face the problem of producing
for herself her more obvious needs. The comparatively
high cost of living is a growing trouble. Infant
though she may be industrially, Argentina has
already experienced the evils of industrial unrest.
The principal manifestations have been in Buenos
Aires, which, in addition to being the port and the
centre of national activities, has been the storm
centre of the rush to exploit her resources. It is
the pulse of the Republic. Like other great cities,
it is crying out against the diminishing value of the
dollar.</p>

<p>Argentina's readiness for home manufactures is
an urgent problem confronting the Government.
The Government wants a more all-round development
of the country's resources. Interwoven with
this problem are important considerations: a more
equable distribution of the population; the provision
of more centres for the exchange of commodities;
the relation between taxes for revenue and protective
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
tariffs; the selection of what industries are to be
established at an economic profit; the extent to
which foreign manufacturers can be induced to start
their industries within the Republic.</p>

<p>So far, the only industries that have continued
with success are those producing articles difficult of
transport, or of an expensive character. With a
greater mobility of trade in the country, and a more
scientific manipulation of the tariff, there is no reason
why Argentina should not provide herself with many
of the things which to-day furnish the labour agitator
with opportunities for tirades against "costly living."
Backed by agricultural wealth, and supported by
splendid railway facilities, Argentina should be able
to make advance on particular lines. Take wool as
an illustration. Argentina produces more than sufficient
for her own requirements, and yet she obtains
woollen goods from other countries. Is it to be
taken as final that the absence of coal in the country
makes the development of woollen industries at home
an economic impossibility? It is not, perhaps, so
much a question of labour and initiative as the
absence of natural advantages.</p>

<p>It is necessary to look farther afield than Buenos
Aires in considering the chances of a new industry.
The concentration of trade in the capital has probably
been a hindrance. The congestion of all
interests, commercial, political, and social, in "B.A."
has caused land to increase enormously in value,
an important consideration in setting up factories.
In turn, other charges are correspondingly increased.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
Trade rises and falls according to the season. There
is less stability for the worker, more fluctuations for
the trader.</p>

<p>But, with railways linking up the interior with the
coast, there is now no necessity for the drama of
Argentina's commerce to be confined to a single
theatre. There must be more centres of exchange,
fresh districts for production and manufacture. If
the auxiliary industries to corn growing and cattle
raising were better fostered there would be no
necessity for inland towns to go to Buenos Aires
for vegetables, eggs, cheese, butter, and poultry.
The market garden, the dairy, the poultry farm, the
orchard, and the auxiliary factories would pour their
products into the provincial centres. Local needs
would be met locally. The surplus would be sent
on with the grain and the cattle to the markets at
Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>These, after all, are probably the safest lines upon
which a new country can travel in her march to
greater economic independence. First the purely
agricultural; then the by-products of agriculture as
a supplement; then gradually the establishment of
whatever manufactures are practicable and profitable.
For the present Argentina has greater need
for cheaper eatables than for cheaper motor-cars.</p>

<p>Countries doing a big trade with the Argentine
are beginning to see the force of providing goods on
the spot. The crowding of agents in the principal
towns has increased competition to a point at which
the next move by certain competitors must be in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
the direction of producing in the country or losing
the trade entirely. This will be all the better for
Argentina. She has long had justifiable cause for
complaint against those who are sent to Buenos
Aires and other parts to barter for her trade. A
well-worn lament in the reports of the British Consul
concerns the English trader's lack of adaptability to
the peculiar conditions of Argentina. Mention is
made of quotations in English, the sending of representatives
unacquainted with the language and
business terms of the country, the adherence to
methods applicable only to England.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the British exporter has grumbled
at economic conditions calling for long and
sometimes exaggerated credit; the taxes levied on
commercial travellers; the difficulty of dealing direct
with customers. Between the two points of view is
the fact that commercial enterprise has stopped
with the arrival of trade representatives in Buenos
Aires.</p>

<p>The Argentine has already made shots at industry
building. Tangible signs of an industrial
future were visible on many occasions during my
tour. Tall and smoking chimneys and busy factories
for tinned meats, clothing, and boots were evidences
of the start already made. Before, however, an
advance can go towards full development there must
be a more definite scheme of working, and a clearer
apprehension of the end in view. There are, for
example, greater possibilities for brewing and distilling.
A recent census showed that these two
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
activities engaged about 160 factories. Sugar, too,
has proved for itself that when worked on proper
lines it is a most profitable industry. Sugar-canes,
formerly exported for others to refine, are now
refined in the country, where the product finds a
ready market.</p>

<p>It would be well-nigh hopeless for Argentina to
attempt the introduction of industries to compete in
her own market with well-established foreign industries
of the same kind without the aid of tariff protection.
This might mean a temporary loss in revenue by
checking imports; but compensation would come
through the success of the home industry. At the
present time Argentina exports in raw wool over
£10,000,000 worth annually. She imports woollen
goods worth nearly £3,000,000. Her imports are
increasing and her export of raw material decreasing.
In ten years the latter fell considerably in actual
bulk, through the rush to make quicker money
from meat. Meanwhile, the question arises as to
why Argentina should not prepare and manufacture
woollen goods for home needs? The existing market
is a large one. Textile industries already exist.
They are few, but the fact that the number of establishments
has increased is a clear proof that textile
industries can be profitable. The opportunities here
presented for the investment of capital are invaluable.
There is room for new and increasing enterprises
in a growing country with many years of
growth before it.</p>

<p>It is essential to all industrial expansion that a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
country's credit should be good and its currency
stable. Argentina is well off in this respect. Contrasted
with some other American republics, in which
revolution, revolt, and financial distress are painfully
frequent, Argentina is a political and financial paradise.
This stability, if not in itself an inducement
to the investment of capital, is at any rate a guarantee
that capital may be invested with safety. And in
these days safety itself is a big inducement. Paper
dollars form the everyday currency of the country.
Careful provision has been made to establish the
paper in circulation on a definite gold basis. Since
the Caja de Conversion, the Government institution
for the issue, exchange, and conversion of the paper
currency, was established in 1899, the paper dollar
has always been worth $.44 gold (between 1s. 8d. and
1s. 9d.). Certain specified resources are appropriated
for the formation of a conversion fund, which guarantees
the paper currency.</p>

<p>During the latter part of 1913 there was a considerable
shipment of English sovereigns to the
Republic. Under the Pellegrini Law passed in 1902
the Caja de Conversion must hold in gold an
equivalent to the paper money in circulation. Indeed,
the National Conversion Office, the National
Bank of Argentina, the London and River Plate
Bank and other banks had in June, 1913, an accumulation
of gold amounting to £67,188,039. The
gold in the Caja de Conversion began with the
insignificant sum of £568 on December 31st, 1902;
in 1904 it was just over £10,000,000; the next
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
year it was up to over £18,000,000, and on June
30th, 1913, it was £53,306,866.</p>

<p>Argentina has a number of well-established banks,
affording many facilities for the development of
trade and industrial enterprise. One of the principal,
the Banco Hipotecario Nacional, makes a feature
of special loans for building and land improvements.
Its loans are made on the mortgages of property
by the issue of bearer bonds in lieu of cash to persons
mortgaging properties to the bank. It need not be
feared, therefore, that industrial enterprises of reasonable
prospects will starve for the want of financial
credit during the difficult years of inauguration.
On the contrary, there is a good supply of money
waiting fresh outlets. Bankers realise that it is to
their own as well as to the country's advantage
to have a wide field of financial operations. They
have the money if others have the enterprise and
the initiative.</p>

<p>The point has now been reached at which manufactories
might well be harnessed to agriculture
not only for the fuller working of Argentina's resources,
but for remedying some of the social difficulties
that have arisen through her relying too
much upon one source of wealth.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

<h3>THE NORTH-EAST COUNTRY</h3>


<p>Although travellers in the Republic usually visit
Rosario, it is seldom they devote much time to
studying the full capabilities of the province of Santa
Fé, of which Rosario is the chief town. Yet Santa
Fé and Corrientes to the north, and Entre Rios to
the east, deserve much more than passing recognition.</p>

<p>Though in the north of Santa Fé, towards the
region of the Chaco, there are thick forests, the
southern part is treeless, except for the ombu, and
is a plain with rich pasturage and soil. Along the
side of the province runs the Parana River, which
can be ascended by flat-bottomed stern wheel vessels
for many hundreds of miles; and from ports like
those of Santa Fé and Villa Constitucion much
agricultural produce in maize, wheat, linseed, and
barley are dispatched. The sugar industry is gradually
creeping into Santa Fé province. Nearly fifty
flour mills have been erected, and there are also
sawmills, meat preserving factories, and works for
quebracho extracts. Though railways are penetrating
in all directions through the province, having
at the present time 3,000 miles of lines, the River
Parana is, and long will be, the chief highway, because
circumstances in the old times led to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
principal towns being constructed on its banks, and
because some of its tributaries are also navigable
for a considerable distance.</p>

<p>The Parana River stretches away north into
Corrientes. There are places with tremendous areas
of well-watered pastures; but the farther north one
journeys the more the country becomes swampy
and covered with heavy forest. The vegetation is
tropical, and parrots with gay plumage disturb the
silence of the woods with their shrieks.</p>

<p>It is here that the forest Indians are to be found,
particularly the Tobas and the Matacos. Formerly
the tribes kept to their own territory; but with the
coming of the white man, and particularly the
importation of Russians, Poles, and Scandinavians
to work in the lumber camps, this custom has gradually
been broken down. The Indians resent the presence
of the intruders, and there is many a black story
of massacre. The forest Indians cannot be induced
to work in the hewing of timber, but missionaries
are doing a great deal in persuading them to take
to farming and raising crops of maize or bananas.</p>

<p>The Indians near the towns on the Parana River
are taking to wearing European clothes. In the
time of the sugar harvest in the west they will work
for a month or so, but on their tramp back of several
hundred miles they frequently fall out with one
another, and there is fierce fighting and murdering
of which the outer world never hears. Far in the
forests, up to the present but little penetrated, the
Indians are found in their original state, naked save
for a loin cloth, producing fire by the rubbing of
sticks, still utilising bows and arrows in warfare,
and following the practice when an enemy has been
slain of cutting off his head and using the skull
as a drinking bowl.</p>

<p>All this may seem to suggest that Corrientes is
a somewhat forbidding province, especially as much
of its territory is marshy. For instance, Lake Ibera
and its marshes covers an area of something like
15,000 square miles. The vegetation is dense, the
climate is bad, and there is little to attract man
unless he be a sportsman. But so vast is the province
that there are wide areas which are very productive,
because the province is well provided with
rivers and streams.</p>

<p>There are in the province about 5,000,000 head
of cattle, over 3,000,000 sheep, and about 600,000
horses. Besides cattle, there are the timber trade
and the sugar industry, also tobacco growing, to be
counted amongst its sources of revenue.</p>

<p>It was only in 1908 that the province of Entre
Rios entered the Republic. As will be gathered from
its name, the province lies "between rivers," the
Parana and Uruguay, both of which are navigable
for many hundreds of miles. There are many
smaller rivers which, although not much good for
traffic, are most useful in watering the country.
Entre Rios has as fertile a soil as will be found in
any part of the Republic. The country is more
picturesque than can be said of Argentina as a whole,
and with its many farms it is often reminiscent of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
England. In the north there are extensive forests;
indeed, one-fifth of the province is covered with
valuable timber. Agricultural products and live
stock are, as elsewhere, the chief source of prosperity.</p>

<p>In the more pleasant undulating parts of the
province there are many prosperous <i>estancias</i>, often
in the possession of Englishmen. Here, more than
in any other place in the Republic, are to be found
small freeholds owned by Austrian, Poles, Russians,
and Scandinavians. The Spanish and Italian Argentines
seem to have left most of this area to north
Europeans, who in many cases retain the costumes
of the countries from which they emigrated. Formerly
Entre Rios had a bad name because of the
stories of the way in which the old settlers shot
every Indian on sight. That, however, is a page
now far back in the history of the land.</p>

<p>Until comparatively recent times the only communication
with the outer world was by means of
the rivers. Now, as mentioned, Entre Rios has a
fine railway system. The capital of the province,
Parana, is a happy-looking, clean town, with exquisite
gardens and, of course, the usual theatre and band.</p>

<p>Most of the meat extract supplied to the world
by the Liebig and Bovril companies comes from
Entre Rios.  Both these companies own great
<i>estancias</i> to breed cattle for the purposes of their
business. Liebigs, which afterwards changed its
name to Lemco, practically built the town of Fray
Bentos, where there were schools, public halls, and,
altogether, a model settlement. Subsequently, however,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
the works were removed to Colon. The Lemco
company own eighteen great estates, covering
1,750,000 acres with nearly 400,000 head of cattle.
The area of their estates is nearly equal to that of
Kent and Surrey.</p>

<p>It was as far back as 1850, long before the frozen
and chilled meat trade came into existence, that
Baron Liebig saw the possibilities, instead of killing
cattle merely for hides and tallow, of boiling down
the meat for extract. The first exportation of 80 lbs.
was in 1865, and it was sent to Germany.</p>

<p>The Bovril company, in Entre Rios and the adjoining
province of Santa Fé, have nearly half a million
acres of freehold and a quarter of a million acres of
leasehold land. On their estates they have about
150,000 cattle. Most of the cattle are of the Durham
breed. Between 80,000 and 100,000 animals are
slaughtered annually, principally at Santa Elena;
and whilst the meat is sent to England to be converted
into meat extract, the hides and tallow are
dispatched to Buenos Aires, where they are sold.</p>

<p>Altogether there are about a quarter of a million
beasts slaughtered in Entre Rios each year. As in
other parts of Argentina, all the slaughter-houses
are under Government inspection; indeed, every
carcase is subjected to examination before it is
passed. Entre Rios is still a long way from the end
of its journey as a meat producing country.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>

<h3>PROSPECTS AND PROBLEMS</h3>


<p>Argentina is a land without ideals. Religion is at
a discount, and as yet nothing worthy of the world's
note has been produced in art or literature. There
is no national conscience. It is a country for money-making,
and, although I may have been unfortunate
in the men I met, I encountered few Argentines who
had thought beyond money.</p>

<p>The Argentines are a people numbering seven
millions&mdash;drawn from the sturdier sections of the
Latin race, reinforced by adventurous spirits from
other races, and backed by the finance of London&mdash;and
their ambitions are large. Argentina is a country
to count in the new regions devoted to providing the
food of the world; and the end of its possibilities is
many generations away.</p>

<p>The travelled Argentine is conscious of the shortcomings
of his countrymen when engaged in the
battle of commerce with men of other nations. So
he sees the need of a helping and guiding hand from
other folk, particularly British. Gradually, however,
other countries are getting their fingers into the pie:
Germany and France. The United States is making
a big endeavour, but, though the North Americans
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
lack nothing in energy, they have completely failed
to win the confidence of the Argentines.</p>

<p>Yet the educated Argentine feels, as foreigners are
quick to notice, that the amalgam of races, with the
Italian leavening the whole, is creating a new people.
The Argentine lad is quick-witted and adaptable, and
he is alert to learn the ways of the foreigner. So,
though it is true enough that you find Englishmen at
the head of many of the great concerns, the Argentine
is pushing his way in and sometimes beating the
foreigner at his own game.</p>

<p>The new spirit is revealed in the way the young
Argentine is taking to sport besides horse-racing:
rowing, tennis, and particularly football. As every
child born in the Republic is by law an Argentine,
it is subject for notice that many young English
fellows native born are more Argentine than those
of Spanish and Italian parentage. It is inevitable
that, proportionately, the strictly Spanish population
will decrease. But the Spanish language remains.
It has a hold in the Western continent from Mexico
to Patagonia.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all that has been accomplished,
one has only to look at a map to realise this region
is to be the home for the overflow of Latin Europe,
and that the scope of commerce at present is slight
compared with its probable dimensions within a few
years. Having some acquaintance with the great
business countries of the world, I say unreservedly
that if I had a son, and intended to put him into
commerce in the hope of his making a fortune quickly,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
I would have him taught Spanish and send him to
South America.</p>

<p>However, there is a slowly accumulating public
opinion that Argentina can do without the foreigner,
that the hour is coming when she should no longer
be exploited in order that large dividends be paid
to investors who live on the other side of the Atlantic.
There is a sort of sub-conscious feeling that it is the
genius of the Argentines themselves which accounts
for the sunshine, the rich soils, the general productivity.
Evidence of that state of mind can be
found in other countries besides Argentina. Yet,
though it is apparent to the most casual observer of
the world's conditions that Argentina must wax in
strength and become increasingly independent, it
is clear that were she to attempt to stand, far
less run, alone she would come a tremendous
cropper.</p>

<p>The pride of the Argentine has to be reckoned upon.
The nation recalls its decrepit past; it sees the
abundant blossom of the present; it eyes are large
when viewing the future. It declines to confound
its destiny with any other South American Republic.
For its northern neighbour Brazil, Portuguese and
negro in population, it has a scorn which raises a
smile on the lips of the outsider.</p>

<p>It resents the patronage of the United States.
When the States preaches the Monroe Doctrine, and
announces it will not allow any European Power to
acquire fresh territory on the American continent,
Argentina says: "It is very kind of you, but we do
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
not require your help; we are quite capable of looking
after ourselves."</p>

<p>Behind this is the belief that the Monroe Doctrine
is but a design to permit the United States to become
the ruling factor in American higher politics, if not
to extend her sphere of authority the entire length
of the continent. The manner in which the United
States got possession of territory in Central America
in order to construct the Panama Canal rankles in
the minds of Argentines, as it does in the minds of
most other South Americans. Bitter though the
feeling is between rival South American States, they
are at one in their resentment of United States
patronage.</p>

<p>Occasionally, United States Ministers of high position
travel south, and beat the pan-American drum.
They are received politely, but there is chilliness in the
courtesy. In blunt truth these Republics&mdash;be they
right or be they wrong in surmise&mdash;do not trust the
United States. I think I am well within the facts
when I state that there is an agreement between
Argentina, Brazil, and Chili&mdash;known as the A.B.C.
combination&mdash;to take common action if there is any
step south of the Panama isthmus savouring of
aggression on the part of the United States.</p>

<p>Both in Argentina and Brazil, when I conversed
with public men, I was given clearly to understand
how deep-seated is this dislike of the United States.
There is annoyance at the manner in which President
Woodrow Wilson has lectured the Latin Republics
of America for granting concessions to European
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
syndicates for the development of their countries.
President Wilson laid it down that the growth of
foreign interests in these Republics was unwholesome,
because they were sure to influence the political
life; therefore, he said, it was the duty of the United
States to assist in emancipating them from such
subordination. This was a considerable extension of
the Monroe Doctrine. The much-preached creed that
the United States will not tolerate any other Power
acquiring territory in the Western hemisphere had
been expanded to mean that the United States is
going to use its influence to free the Latin Republics
from being under obligation to European countries
which have given their millions of gold towards
making those Republics commercially prosperous
which, so far as financial assistance from the United
States counts, would have remained practically
undeveloped. At the latter end of 1913 Mr. Page,
United States Ambassador to Great Britain, stated
at a public dinner that President Wilson was determined
to assert the principle that no sort of European
financial or industrial control could, with the
consent of the United States, be got over the weak
nations of America so far as this control affected
political influence.</p>

<p>What European countries think about this attitude
of the United States in practically warning off
European financiers if the investments or concessions
have an influence over politics&mdash;which, of course,
they must have in all trading countries&mdash;it is not
for me to discuss here. But this over-lordship, this
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
placing of the Latin Republics in a position of tutelage
to the great Republic of the north, is denounced and
repudiated by every Latin American public man.</p>

<p>I quite agree that it would be better for countries
like Argentina and Brazil if they were not so dependent
on the foreign capitalist. That is a view held by
probably the majority of South Americans themselves.
But they are not going to accept dictation from the
United States, especially as they know that United
States financiers and syndicates are not only endeavouring
to control the meat trade of Argentina, but
within the last year or so have been engaged in
gigantic negotiations to secure ultimately a controlling
voice in many of the most important railway
concerns.</p>

<p>In the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies in December
of 1913, Señor Pedro Moacyr questioned whether,
even should the United States spare Brazil the fate
meted out to Colombia, in regard to setting up the
baby Republic of Panama so that the North Americans
could construct the Panama Canal, Brazil would
accept the tutelage over Latin America which President
Wilson, improving on the imperialism of Mr.
Roosevelt himself, and yet further accentuating the
disquieting deviations of the Monroe Doctrine, had
proclaimed? What it came to was, said Señor
Moacyr, "that the Latin Republics are no longer to
have the right to grant to foreigners such concessions
and privileges as it may suit them to grant, and,
under pretext of preserving them from a problematical
European imperialism, the United States will
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
subject them to its own domination and control.
What, in this case, becomes of the integrity and
sovereignty of Latin America for which the great
Republic displays so much solicitude? More and
more the Monroe Doctrine, new style, displays this
manifest tendency: America for the United States....
Will the great Latin Republics be willing to
submit to this American control, and subordinate
their foreign policy and their economic orientation
to the views and interests of Washington? We do
not believe it."</p>

<p>It is only right that United States financiers
should receive privileges the same as are accorded
to the financiers of other countries; but such a
pronouncement as that of President Wilson only
intensifies the distrust of South Americans, so that
when looking beyond their own frontiers for money
they are more disposed to direct their gaze across
the Atlantic than to the people of the United States.
What may be taken as quite certain is that the big
Latin Republics have sufficient confidence in themselves
to refuse to accept any lectures from North
Americans.</p>

<p>Coming late into the field the United States is
now making strenuous endeavours to increase its
trade with Argentina. Operations in regard to railways,
and creating a meat monopoly in the hands
of Chicago firms, provide the most striking proof.
In regard to the creation of a meat trust, there is
now a Bill before the Argentine Parliament providing
that any contract relating to commerce or transport
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
affecting the price to the consumer of articles of prime
necessity is illegal. Those who form the trust can,
under this measure, be punished for misdemeanour,
and directors of companies or associations will be
held personally responsible, and on repetition of the
offence their companies or associations dissolved and
effects confiscated.</p>

<p>At the present time there is a great American
railway scheme to link up the railway lines in Argentina
and Brazil with a line running through the
Republics right up to New York, making a track
over 10,000 miles in length and involving the building
of nearly 3,700 more miles of line. The British
Consul-General at Buenos Aires, Mr. Mackie, one of
the most distinguished men in the British Consular
service, says, in regard to this pan-American railway
enterprise: "It would seem that out of the 3,648
miles of railway over which it was sought to acquire
control, only 1,906 miles needed for carrying out
the scheme in Argentina have been acquired up to
the present. This untoward circumstance must of
necessity substantially increase the original estimates
of the mileage needed for linking up the railway
systems of the Republics lying between Buenos Aires
and New York. The dominion of the American
controlled enterprise is not apparently to be confined
to the narrow limits of railway undertakings,
but it would seem that a lengthy list of subsidiary
companies has been grouped with the syndicate, in
whose London offices appear to be centred a South
American lumber company, three development and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
colonisation companies, a Para rubber company, a
port company, two navigation companies, a tramway
company, light and power company, and an
hotel company."</p>

<p>With such endeavours on the part of the United
States to extend its power in the south, it is the obvious
commercial duty of Great Britain not only to take
stock of what is happening, but to take steps to
meet it. When I was in Buenos Aires I was glad to
hear of the formation of a British Chamber of Commerce.
Hitherto English people with interests in
Argentina have worked independently and sometimes
in rivalry. Of course, wholesome rivalry should continue;
but there are occasions when the British
commercial community should act in concert, and
the creation of the British Chamber of Commerce,
with Sir Reginald Tower, the British Minister, giving
it his active patronage, should be of immense advantage.</p>

<p>But all foreigners, be they British, German, French,
or belonging to the United States, must recognise the
ambition of the Argentines ultimately to do without
them and to "run the show" for themselves.</p>

<p>The nationality of Argentina is not founded on
tradition; it comes from the fervour of self-appreciation.
Despite the growth of Socialism in the ports
the country gives unprecedented scope for individual
daring&mdash;gambling on the future if you like. The
doors are open to all the races of Europe to become
Argentines. The terror of Asiatic labour, which
troubles some other new countries, will be slain
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
by the readiness with which all Europeans are received,
be they Russians or Turks. By marriage the
race is a jumble of Spanish, natives, Italians, and
northern Europeans. In North America a man or
a woman with a drop of black blood is called "a
nigger." Unlike Brazil, there are few negroes in
Argentina; but many of the best families have
native Indian blood in their veins. In South America
a half-caste, a <i>mestizo</i>, is always counted as a white.
Thus there are no race prejudices such as are to be
found in so democratic a country as the United States.</p>

<p>Yet there is no new country where there is such
a gap between one section of the population and the
other. I ascribe the scanty intellectual life of the
Argentine to the big break between the plutocracy
and the labouring classes. The poor immigrant has
an enormous struggle to raise himself above the condition
of a serf. There are plenty of exceptions, but
notwithstanding this the statement holds good. To
those who have wealth, money to play with, increase
in possession comes rapidly. There is little scope
for the salary-earning middle class&mdash;a most valuable
class in all communities&mdash;and, though wages are
high according to European standards, the advance
is not so great when the heavy cost of living is borne
in mind.</p>

<p>So far I have endeavoured fairly to picture Argentina
as it is. It would be idle not to count the disadvantages
along with the merits of the land. I did
not go to South America with any preconceived ideas,
but to see what I could and write about what I saw
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
and learnt. It has not benefits for poor agriculturists
such as Canada offers, though the life is more
pleasant. Out on the plains the climate is splendid.
It is not a country for the clerk whose knowledge of
Spanish is nil.</p>

<p>But it is an amazing country nevertheless. For
ages it has been lying in the womb of Time. It has
just been born, and its growth is one of the wonders
of the world. Its inhabitants are quickly adapting
themselves to modern needs. The revolutionary days
are of the past. It has millions of acres under the
power of man; it has many millions more awaiting
population. It is crying out for population. And
great steamers from Spain and from Italy are driving
southwards over the line of the Equator carrying what
Argentina needs. She receives nearly three hundred
thousand new arrivals annually. And within a
couple of years most of them become Argentine
citizens.</p>
